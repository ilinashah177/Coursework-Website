From geopolitics \\n\\nto markets to the natural environment, across much of the globe, its impacts are far-reaching. \\n\\nThe Center on Global Energy Policy’s Belt and Road Initiative Paper Series o�ers research and \\n\\ncommentary on the BRI and its implications around the world. It covers a range of energy-\\n\\nrelated topics and o�ers di�erent points of view.\\n\\nIn this paper, CGEP Fellow Erica Downs examines the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor \\n\\n(CPEC), focusing on the financing and construction of coal-fired power plants by Chinese \\n\\nstate-owned entities.

China \\n\\nis helping Pakistan expand its coal-fired generation capacity through the financing and \\n\\nconstruction of coal power plants as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). \\n\\nCPEC is a component of Chinese president Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which \\n\\naims to forge greater global connectivity in part through infrastructure development. Nearly \\n\\n75 percent of the generation capacity of CPEC power plants is coal-fired. Pakistan’s National \\n\\nElectric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) expects that CPEC coal power plants will be \\n\\nlargely responsible for the projected increase in the country’s coal-fired generation capacity \\n\\nfrom 3 percent as of June 30, 2017 (fewer than six months after the first CPEC coal plant \\n\\nbegan commercial operation), to 20 percent in 2025.\\n\\nAs part of its series on the Belt and Road Initiative, Columbia University’s Center on Global \\n\\nEnergy Policy initiated research into the CPEC power sector projects, which account for the \\n\\nmajority of the cost of CPEC projects. This paper examines two of the key concerns critics \\n\\nhave about the BRI: environmental sustainability and debt sustainability. Concerns about \\n\\nenvironmental sustainability center on the ways in which an expansion of the amount of \\n\\nelectricity generated globally by fossil fuels, especially coal, will increase greenhouse gas \\n\\nemissions, making it more di�cult if not impossible to meet the emissions targets in the Paris \\n\\nAgreement. Concerns about debt sustainability focus on whether China’s lending in support \\n\\nof infrastructure projects will lead to problematic increases in debt, with some analysts \\n\\nmaintaining that Beijing is intentionally seeking to push countries into debt distress in an \\n\\nattempt to gain control over strategic assets or decision-making in borrowing countries.\\n\\nThe main findings of this study are threefold.\\n\\n ● First, the heavy focus on coal in the new generation capacity added by the CPEC power \\n\\nprojects stems from both “pull” factors from Pakistan and “push” factors from China:\\n\\n − The CPEC coal power projects reflect Pakistan’s long-standing goal of diversifying \\n\\nits generation mix away from fuel oil toward domestic coal in an attempt to \\n\\ndecrease generation costs and conserve foreign exchange. They also reflect the \\n\\nperception of the administration of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, whose \\n\\npledge to end power outages helped his party win the 2013 election, that coal \\n\\nwas the best option to bring on a large amount of new capacity in the short term. \\n\\nAlthough Pakistan has vast renewable energy potential, solar and wind power were \\n\\nconsidered too expensive and di�cult to integrate into electric grids.\\n\\n − Meanwhile, Chinese companies had several reasons to sell coal power plants to \\n\\nPakistan, including exporting rather than warehousing excess power generation \\n\\nequipment, financial incentives provided by Beijing and Islamabad, and the ability \\n\\nto execute projects fast enough to help Sharif eradicate the blackouts hurting \\n\\nPakistan’s economy before he stood for reelection in 2018.\\n\\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n8 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\n ● Second, there is a mismatch between the dominance of coal in the CPEC power \\n\\ngeneration mix and Beijing’s recent emphasis on green development as an important \\n\\nfeature of the BRI. This gap between Beijing’s rhetoric and the reality on the ground \\n\\ncan be explained in large part by Pakistan’s preference for building coal-fired \\n\\ngeneration capacity. Ultimately, it is up to the host country to decide the composition \\n\\nof its electricity mix. The Chinese government has a long-standing reluctance \\n\\nto interfere in decisions of this type. Moreover, China regards some of the CPEC \\n\\ncoal power plants as environmentally friendly because they use relatively modern \\n\\ntechnologies and are expected to emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the fuel \\n\\noil plants Pakistan is replacing.\\n\\n ● Third, there is a risk that the CPEC power projects will add to Pakistan’s sovereign \\n\\ndebt burden, but multiple factors indicate that any increase in sovereign debt from \\n\\nthese projects is unlikely to be the result of a deliberate strategy on the part of China. \\n\\nAlthough the debt financing arrangements for CPEC power sector projects primarily \\n\\ninvolve loans from Chinese banks to project companies wholly or partly owned by \\n\\nChinese firms, these projects may increase Pakistan’s debt because of sovereign \\n\\nguarantees issued by Islamabad to support CPEC power projects and the liquidity \\n\\ncrisis in Pakistan’s power sector known as circular debt. That said, several aspects \\n\\nof the China-Pakistan relationship and the large stake that China’s government and \\n\\ncompanies have in the success of CPEC indicate that Chinese interests are better \\n\\nserved by sustainable CPEC projects than unsustainable ones.�\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 9\\n\\nIn May 2013, Chinese premier Li Keqiang proposed that China and Pakistan focus on developing \\n\\n“priority projects in connectivity, energy development and power generation” and an economic \\n\\ncorridor linking the two countries.1 China and Pakistan formally launched the China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) nearly two years later when President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad \\n\\nin April 2015.2 CPEC is a collection of energy and transport projects, some of which will connect \\n\\nwestern China to the Arabian Sea.3 The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan reported that as of the \\n\\nend of 2018, 22 CPEC projects worth US$18.9 billion had been initiated or completed.4 Although \\n\\n$18.9 billion is far below the $62 billion often cited as the value of the CPEC project portfolio, it \\n\\nis nonetheless a considerable amount of foreign capital for Pakistan.5 \\n\\nThe Chinese government has regarded CPEC as the bellwether of President Xi Jinping’s Belt \\n\\nand Road Initiative (BRI), which he unveiled in 2013.6 Once described by Xi as a “project of the \\n\\ncentury,” the BRI aims to forge greater global connectivity, including through the construction \\n\\nof infrastructure, notably in emerging economies.7 The initial importance of CPEC as the leading \\n\\nedge of the BRI is reflected in the oft quoted remark made by China’s foreign minister Wang \\n\\nYi in 2015: “if ‘One Belt, One Road,’ is like a sweet symphony involving and benefitting every \\n\\ncountry, then the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the sweet symphony \\n\\nof the melody’s first movement.”8 \\n\\nPower sector projects are a large component of CPEC.  Generation and transmission projects \\n\\naccount for 7 of the 11 CPEC projects completed and 6 of the 11 CPEC projects under \\n\\nconstruction at the end of 2018.9 In addition, the 15 power sector projects that comprise the \\n\\nCPEC energy priority projects—those initially scheduled for completion by 2020 and the \\n\\nsubject of this study—represent 55 percent of the value of all the projects on the government of \\n\\nPakistan’s CPEC website with an estimated cost listed ($20.9 billion out of $38.6 billion).10 This \\n\\nfocus on power projects reflects the determination of former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz \\n\\nSharif to honor his campaign promise, which helped his party win the 2013 elections, to end \\n\\nPakistan’s chronic electricity shortages.\\n\\nThree-quarters of the new generation capacity to be added by the CPEC power sector projects \\n\\nis from coal-fired power plants. If all these plants are constructed, they will be a major driver \\n\\nin Pakistan’s increasing reliance on coal for electricity. Indeed, the government of Pakistan \\n\\nexpects the CPEC power plants to contribute to an expansion of coal’s share in Pakistan’s power \\n\\ngeneration mix from 3 percent on June 30, 2017, to 20 percent on June 30, 2025.11 This push to \\n\\nproduce more electricity from coal stands in contrast to the move away from coal for power \\n\\ngeneration in other countries in recent years.12 \\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n10 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nAn investigation into the projects being developed by Chinese firms in Pakistan’s power sector \\n\\nin the more than four years since the launch of CPEC provides an opportunity to draw some \\n\\ninitial conclusions about two issues that lie at the heart of criticisms of the BRI—environmental \\n\\nsustainability and debt sustainability. On the former, there are concerns that BRI infrastructure, \\n\\nespecially coal power plants, will negatively impact the environment in a variety of ways, \\n\\nincluding by harming the global climate and polluting air and water. On the latter, there are \\n\\nconcerns that BRI infrastructure projects may result in problematic increases in debt, with \\n\\nsome critics worried that China is intentionally seeking to push borrowing countries into debt \\n\\ndistress to gain strategic leverage over them.13 \\n\\nPUNJAB\\n\\nSINDH\\n\\nGILGIT-\\nBALTISTANKHYBER\\n\\nPAKHTUNKHWA\\n\\nBALOCHISTAN\\n\\nPort Qasim coal \\npower plant\\n\\nSuki Kinari  \\nhydropower station\\n\\nSahiwal coal power plant\\n\\nCoal power plant\\n\\nSurface mine\\n\\nHydropower station\\n\\nWind farm\\n\\nSolar park\\n\\nHVDC transmission line\\n\\n• Engro Thar Block II coal power & mine project  \\n• TEL Thar Block II coal power project  \\n• Thalnova Thar Block II coal power project  \\n• Thar Block II surface mine\\n\\nHydro China Dawood wind farm\\n\\nGwadar coal project\\n\\n Quaid-e-Azam solar park\\n\\nUEP \\nwind \\nfarm\\n\\nSachal  \\nwind farm\\n\\n Three Gorges Second and Third \\nwind power projects\\n\\nKarot hydropower station\\n\\nSSRL Thar Block I coal power & mine project\\n\\n • Matiari-Lahore HVDC \\n   transmission line \\n• Matiari (Port Qasim)-Faisalabad \\n   HVDC transmission line\\n\\nHub coal \\npower plant\\n\\nThar Mine Mouth Oracle power plant and \\nsurface mine\\n\\nLocations of CPEC energy priority projects\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 11\\n\\nThe key questions addressed by this study include the following:\\n\\n ● Why is the power generation capacity being developed under CPEC so heavily skewed \\n\\ntoward coal?\\n\\n ● What accounts for the disconnect between Beijing’s emphasis on green development \\n\\nas a feature of the BRI and the coal-fired power plants being constructed with Chinese \\n\\nfinance in Pakistan?\\n\\n ● Is China deliberately using the CPEC power projects to push Pakistan into debt distress?\\n\\nThe answers to these questions are based on a variety of English and Chinese sources \\n\\nincluding Chinese and Pakistani government documents, media reports, industry publications, \\n\\ncorporate documents, public statements made by o�cials and power company executives, \\n\\nand interviews with experts on the economies and energy sectors of China and Pakistan.\\n\\nThe main findings of this study are threefold. First, the fact that almost three-quarters of the \\n\\nnew generation capacity to be added by the CPEC “early harvest” power projects is from coal \\n\\npower plants is the result of both a “pull” from Pakistan and a “push” from China. Second, the \\n\\ndisconnect between the dominance of coal in the CPEC power generation mix and Beijing’s \\n\\nemphasis on green development as an important feature of the BRI is largely due to Pakistan’s \\n\\nlong-standing preference for producing more electricity from coal. Third, although the CPEC \\n\\npower projects may increase Pakistan’s debt burden because of sovereign guarantees and the \\n\\nliquidity crisis in Pakistan’s power sector known as “circular debt,” multiple factors indicate \\n\\nit is unlikely that Beijing is purposely seeking to trap Pakistan in a debt crisis in a bid to gain \\n\\nassets and influence in Pakistan.\\n\\nThis study has three sections. Part one introduces the CPEC power projects and explains why \\n\\nthe new generation capacity they are adding is heavily skewed toward coal. Part two details \\n\\nwhy there is a gap between the focus of CPEC power projects on coal-fired generation and \\n\\nBeijing’s aspiration to build a greener BRI. Part three discusses what China’s involvement in \\n\\nPakistan’s power sector tells us about concerns that Beijing intentionally seeks to increase the \\n\\ndebt burdens of borrowing countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n12 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nThe CPEC power sector projects, which are for the production and transmission of electricity, \\n\\nare rooted in Pakistan’s need for additional power generation capacity.

These \\n\\nincentives were very successful in quickly securing private sector investment, resulting in \\n\\nroughly 4,000 MW of new generation capacity.18 \\n\\nThe bulk of this investment was in power plants that ran on imported fuel oil, in part \\n\\nbecause the low oil prices of the 1990s made fuel oil an inexpensive option.19 These \\n\\nprojects contributed to a substantial transformation of Pakistan’s power generation mix. \\n\\nHydropower’s share of installed generation capacity fell from around 67 percent in 1985 to \\n\\n27 percent in 2017, while oil’s share was 26 percent in 2017.20 The dramatic increase in oil \\n\\nprices in the 2000s (reaching a high of $147 per barrel in 2008) caused Pakistan’s power \\n\\ngeneration costs to skyrocket.\\n\\nPakistan’s reliance on fuel oil for power generation has contributed to the liquidity crisis \\n\\nin the country’s power sector known as circular debt, which in turn contributes to the \\n\\ncountry’s frequent power outages. The term refers to the fact that entities in the power \\n\\nsector generally do not have enough money to pay each other for long periods of time.21 The \\n\\nsole buyer of all grid-connected electricity produced in Pakistan is the government-owned \\n\\nCentral Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). CPPA buys the electricity from the generation \\n\\ncompanies and sells it to the distribution companies, which sell it to consumers.22 However, \\n\\nthe distribution companies are often unable to pay CPPA in full due to factors including \\n\\nthe failure of the government to compensate them in a timely manner for below-market \\n\\ntari�s, customers being unwilling or unable to pay their bills in full, theft, technical losses, \\n\\nand distribution losses. As a result, the CPPA lacks the funds it needs to pay the generation \\n\\ncompanies, which in turn do not have enough money to pay the fuel suppliers.23 The fuel \\n\\nsuppliers, in turn, cut o� supplies in response to nonpayment, forcing generators to shut \\n\\ndown for extended periods of time and contributing to electricity shortages. For example, \\n\\nin Pakistan’s fiscal year 2014, circular debt resulted in the idling of 5 gigawatts (GW) of \\n\\ngeneration capacity, which was almost 22 percent of the total installed capacity.24 \\n\\nPakistan’s power shortages have taken a toll on its economy. The World Bank estimates \\n\\nthat blackouts have reduced the country’s GDP by 2 percent per annum in recent years.25  \\n\\nPakistan’s textile industry, a major source of export revenue, has been hard hit. Media \\n\\nreports have documented the woes of companies in Faisalabad, Pakistan’s cloth capital, \\n\\nwhere power outages had forced hundreds of units to close and left tens of thousands of \\n\\nworkers jobless as of 2011.26 \\n\\nPakistanis took to the streets in the early 2010s (and beyond) to protest the electricity \\n\\nshortages. Rioters enraged about the government’s inability to provide electricity during hot \\n\\nsummer weather stormed the house of a politician, torched police vans, and looted shops.27  \\n\\nDoctors and nurses picketed outside hospitals, where power outages contributed to a lack \\n\\nof clean water and canceled operations.28 \\n\\nSharif tapped into this discontent in his successful bid to become prime minister for the \\n\\nthird time in 2013. He blamed the previous government for the country’s plunge into \\n\\ndarkness and the resulting harm to Pakistan’s economy, arguing that “it [would] be di�cult \\n\\nto identify another example of collective national failure of policies and governance of \\n\\nthis magnitude.”29 Campaigning under the slogan “Bright Pakistan,” he vowed to end the \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n14 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\npower shortages within two years if elected.30 His manifesto for the 2013 election outlines \\n\\na series of measures to resolve the energy crisis and boost economic growth, including \\n\\nthe development of at least 5,000 MW of new coal power plants and an investment of $20 \\n\\nbillion to generate 10,000 MW of electricity in the next five years.31 \\n\\nAfter his victory, Sharif wasted little time in letting China know that Pakistan’s power sector \\n\\nwas open to Chinese firms for more business. When China’s premier Li Keqiang visited \\n\\nPakistan less than two weeks after the general election in May 2013, Sharif requested that \\n\\nChina build another nuclear power plant for Pakistan.32 Premier Li was receptive to Sharif’s \\n\\noverture, proposing that China and Pakistan not only cooperate in the development of \\n\\npower generation projects but also the construction of a bilateral economic corridor.33 Li’s \\n\\nremarks appear to have emboldened Sharif. When he visited China on his first overseas trip \\n\\nas premier in July 2013, he lobbied executives at the Export-Import Bank of China, China \\n\\nDevelopment Bank, and China Investment Corporation, China’s sovereign wealth fund, telling \\n\\nthem that there were great opportunities for the development of coal-fired power plants \\n\\nand hydropower plants in Pakistan.34 \\n\\nThese visits laid the groundwork for the prioritization of power generation in CPEC. 13 of the \\n\\n15 projects on the list of CPEC-Energy Priority Projects initially scheduled for completion \\n\\nby 2020 (the dates for some projects have slipped) are power generation projects; the \\n\\nothers are transmission lines (see table 2). The total amounts of generation capacity and \\n\\ninvestment for the current CPEC energy priority projects essentially match the numbers in \\n\\nSharif’s manifesto. The combined capacity of the CPEC energy priority projects is 11,190 MW \\n\\n(compared to 10,000 MW in the manifesto), and the total estimated cost of the projects is \\n\\nat least $20.9 billion (compared to the $20 billion in the manifesto), with the costs of two \\n\\nprojects still to be determined. Moreover, the CPEC power projects align with Sharif’s call \\n\\nfor generating more electricity from coal. Nearly three-quarters of this new capacity is from \\n\\ncoal-fired power plants; the remaining 25 percent is a mix of hydro, wind, and solar power \\n\\n(see figure 1).\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 15\\n\\nTable 2: CPEC energy priority projects\\n\\nProject Fuel Capacity \\n(MW)\\n\\nEstimated \\ncost (US$ \\nmillion)\\n\\nCommercial \\noperation date\\n\\n1 Port Qasim coal power plant Imported coal 1,320 1,912.2 April 2018\\n\\n2 Suki Kinari hydropower station Hydro\\n870 1,707 December 2022\\n\\n3 Sahiwal coal power plant Imported coal 1,320 1,912.2 October 2017\\n\\n4 Engro Thar Block II coal power \\nand mine project\\n\\nDomestic coal 660 995.4 July 2019\\n\\nTEL Thar Block II coal power \\nproject\\n\\nDomestic coal 330 497.7 July 2019\\n\\nThalnova Thar Block II coal \\npower project\\n\\nDomestic coal 330 497.7 July 2019\\n\\nThar Block II surface mine 1,470 December 2018\\n\\n5 Hydro China Dawood wind \\nfarm\\n\\nWind 50 112.65 April 2017\\n\\n6 Gwadar coal power project Imported coal 300 Not yet \\ndetermined Not yet determined\\n\\n7 Quaid-e-Azam solar park Solar 1000 1,302 August 2016     \\n(300 MW)\\n\\n8 UEP wind farm Wind 100 250 June 2017\\n\\n9 Sachal wind farm Wind 50 134 April 2017\\n\\n10 SSRL Thar Block I coal power \\nand mine project\\n\\nDomestic coal 1,320 1,912.2 Expected \\n2018/2019\\n\\n11 Karot hydropower station Hydro 720 1,698 December 2021\\n\\n12 Three Gorges second and third \\nwind power projects\\n\\nWind 100 150 June and July 2018\\n\\n13 Hub coal power plant Imported coal 1,320 1,912.2 February 2019  \\n(660 MW)\\n\\n14 Matiari-Lahore HVDC \\ntransmission line 1,658 March 2021\\n\\nMatiari (Port Qasim)-Faisalabad \\nHVDC transmission line 1,500 2018/2019\\n\\n15 Thar Mine Mouth Oracle power \\nplant and surface mine\\n\\nDomestic coal 1,400 Not yet \\ndetermined Not yet determined\\n\\nSource: CPEC Secretariat, “CPEC-Energy Priority Projects,” China Pakistan Economic Corridor, accessed \\nJune 27, 2019, http://cpec.gov.pk/energy.\\n\\nhttp://cpec.gov.pk/energy\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n16 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nFIgure 1: Generation capacity of CPEC power plants by fuel\\n\\nSource: CPEC Secretariat, “CPEC-Energy Priority Projects,” China Pakistan Economic Corridor, accessed \\nJune 27, 2019, http://cpec.gov.pk/energy.\\n\\nThe CPEC power projects are helping to reduce—and should eliminate—Pakistan’s power \\n\\ngeneration gap. If all the power plants included in the list of CPEC energy priority projects are \\n\\ncompleted as planned, they would add 11,190 MW of new capacity. 11,190 MW is 45 percent \\n\\nof Pakistan’s total installed capacity of 24,823 MW as of June 30, 2015 (two months after the \\n\\nlaunch of CPEC), and is more than the extra capacity Pakistan needed to meet its record high \\n\\n9,000 MW power shortage on June 25, 2018.35 \\n\\nIf all the CPEC coal power plants are developed, they will also substantially increase the role \\n\\nof coal in Pakistan’s power generation mix.

Islamabad’s quest to substantially \\n\\nincrease the use of coal in power generation dovetailed with Beijing’s ambitions to find new \\n\\nmarkets for Chinese manufacturers of coal power equipment as China greens its electricity \\n\\nmix and the generous financial incentives o�ered by Islamabad and Beijing to spur Chinese \\n\\npower companies to develop power plants in Pakistan. In addition, Chinese companies and \\n\\nfinancial institutions were willing to help Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif fulfill his campaign \\n\\npromise of ending power outages before he stood for reelection in 2018 by fast-tracking the \\n\\nexecution of CPEC power projects.\\n\\nThe “Pull” from Pakistan\\n\\nThe large number of coal-fired power plants on the list of CPEC energy priority projects \\n\\nreflects the importance Islamabad has attached to increasing the role of coal in the country’s \\n\\npower generation mix.

Pakistan’s Policy for Power \\n\\nGeneration Projects 2002 sought to attract international and domestic investment in the \\n\\ndevelopment of indigenous resources including coal.40 As the country’s federal minister for \\n\\nWater and Power stated in 2004, “the objective of the Government is to facilitate investors \\n\\nin developing coal mines and coal power plants in Pakistan.”41 Similarly, the National Power \\n\\nPolicy 2013 calls for the “development of coastal energy corridors based upon imported \\n\\ncoal (later mixed with local coal), rapid proliferation of coal mining all across the country—\\n\\nespecially at Thar,” and the conversion of fuel oil power plants to coal power plants.42 \\n\\nThe government of Pakistan believes that the key to transforming the country’s power \\n\\ngeneration fuel mix lies in the development of the abundant coal reserves in the Thar Desert \\n\\nin the country’s southern Sindh Province. The Geological Survey of Pakistan, which discovered \\n\\nthe coal deposits with the US Agency for International Development in 1992, estimates that \\n\\nthey hold around 175 billion tons of coal, making Thar one of the world’s largest lignite coal \\n\\nreserves.43 According to a former federal minister for Water and Power, “God has blessed \\n\\nPakistan with immense coal resources of more than 185.5 billion tonnes, and if half of these \\n\\nresources are exploited properly, it would be su�cient for generating 100,000 MW of \\n\\nelectricity for 30 years.”44 \\n\\nThe Thar coal reserves had remained largely unexploited until the launch of CPEC. As \\n\\nPakistan’s Private Power and Infrastructure Board explained in 2004, the country’s coal \\n\\nreserves had not been developed due to a lack of infrastructure, financing, and technical \\n\\nexpertise.45 Many companies shied away from investing in Thar coal in part because its poor \\n\\nquality made it costly to mine.46 (The Thar desert contains lignite coal, which General Electric \\n\\n(GE) has described as being “about as combustible as soggy logs in a fireplace.”47) Moreover, \\n\\nsome international financial institutions including the World Bank and the European Bank \\n\\nfor Reconstruction and Development, have restricted financing for the development of coal-\\n\\nfired generation because of concerns about carbon emissions.48 The World Bank, for example, \\n\\nwithdrew its support for a Thar coal and power project in 2009 because it was inconsistent \\n\\nwith the bank’s focus on low-carbon technologies.49 As a result, China has emerged as a \\n\\nlender of last resort for Pakistan’s coal power plants. According to Shahzad Qasim, the special \\n\\nassistant to Prime Minister Imran Khan on the power sector, “finding international financing for \\n\\ncoal has been di�cult, with China the only country willing to invest.”50 \\n\\nGenerate Cheaper Electricity\\n\\nThe large amount of coal-fired generation capacity added by CPEC power projects reflects \\n\\nthe Pakistani government’s long-standing objective of diversifying the country’s fuel mix away \\n\\nfrom oil products to coal to generate cheaper electricity. In Pakistan’s fiscal year 2014, for \\n\\nexample, 40 percent of the country’s generation capacity was based on residual fuel oil and \\n\\nhigh speed diesel, while just 0.1 percent was based on coal.51 The cost of electricity generated \\n\\nfrom these oil products, which are largely imported, has been much higher than electricity \\n\\ngenerated by other fuels, especially coal. During Pakistan’s fiscal year 2014, the average \\n\\ngeneration cost of electricity produced from residual fuel oil was four times higher than that \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 19\\n\\nof coal (see table 3).52 It was this gap between the generation costs of oil products and coal \\n\\nthat underpinned Islamabad’s decision to replace fuel oil with coal in power generation in the \\n\\nhope that it will reduce the cost of electricity.53 \\n\\nTable 3: Pakistan’s average cost of generation (rupees/kilowatt hour) in fiscal years 2014 to 2015\\n\\nSource Fiscal year 2014 Fiscal year 2015\\n\\nHydro\\n\\nResidual fuel oil 16.0 12.4\\n\\nGas 4.8 4.7\\n\\nHigh speed diesel 22.2 17.4\\n\\nCoal 4.0 4.5\\n\\nNuclear 1.3 1.2\\n\\nWind\\n\\nSource: State Bank of Pakistan, Annual Report 2014–2015, 34, http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/annual/\\narFY15/Energy.pdf.\\n\\nConserve Foreign Exchange\\n\\nThe large number of coal-fired power plants being developed as part of CPEC also reflects \\n\\nIslamabad’s conviction that increasing the role of coal in Pakistan’s power generation mix \\n\\nwould reduce the country’s import bill. Pakistan’s State Planning Commission estimated in \\n\\n2011 that the conversion of the country’s 12 fuel-oil-fired power plants to coal-fired power \\n\\nplants could save $8 billion dollars, or almost 4 percent of GDP, based on the price of furnace \\n\\noil and the exchange rate at that time.54 Similarly, the State Bank of Pakistan estimated in its \\n\\nannual report for 2013–2014 that if the Jamshoro Power Plant, which the Asian Development \\n\\nBank is helping convert from fuel oil to coal-fired generation, had been converted to coal \\n\\nearlier, it would have reduced Pakistan’s import bill in fiscal year 2014 by $418 million if fueled \\n\\nby imported coal and $716 million if fueled by domestic coal.55\\n\\nNo Better Option in the Short Term\\n\\nThe dominance of coal-fired generation capacity in CPEC power projects reflected the view of \\n\\nthe Sharif administration that coal plants were the best way for Pakistan to bring online a large \\n\\namount of new generation capacity in a short period of time. In February 2014 Shahbaz Sharif, \\n\\nthen the chief minister of Punjab Province (and brother of the prime minister), stated that the \\n\\ngovernment preferred coal power plants because they were the shortest way to resolve the \\n\\nenergy crisis.56 In February 2015 NEPRA similarly argued that coal-fired generation was the best \\n\\nway to quickly increase the share of cheaper fuels in Pakistan’s power generation mix when it \\n\\ngranted a generation license for the Port Qasim coal power plant developed as part of CPEC:\\n\\nhttp://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/annual/arFY15/Energy.pdf\\nhttp://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/annual/arFY15/Energy.pdf\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n20 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nThe Authority considers it imperative that e�orts be made to change the energy \\n\\nmix based on relatively cheap fuels. In view of the depleting natural gas reserves \\n\\nin the country and the relatively longer lead time for hydro electric power projects \\n\\nto materialize, the coal power plants are considered the best option in the short \\n\\nand medium term planning. Therefore, in order to reduce the demand-supply \\n\\npower-gap and achieve sustainable development, it is vital that indigenous as \\n\\nwell as imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their \\n\\ndevelopment is encouraged.57\\n\\nThis preference for coal is despite Pakistan’s vast renewable energy potential. Wind and \\n\\nsolar plants could have been developed quickly, helping meet Sharif’s goals of bringing new \\n\\ngeneration capacity online rapidly and increasing the use of domestic resources to generate \\n\\nelectricity. Yet renewable energy projects account for only 12 percent of the generation \\n\\ncapacity of the CPEC energy priority projects. There are probably several reasons for \\n\\nIslamabad’s decision to give renewable energy projects a minor role in CPEC and in resolving \\n\\nthe country’s electricity crisis.\\n\\nFirst, there are concerns within Islamabad about the ability of the country’s overutilized \\n\\ntransmission system to incorporate large amounts of new variable generation.58 Indeed, \\n\\nNEPRA noted in its State of the Industry Report 2015 that renewable energy should be \\n\\ninducted gradually into the system and that detailed studies “to identify short term and \\n\\nlong term expansion plans for strengthening the grid system” need to be conducted in \\n\\norder to create more space for renewable energy on the grid.59 Similarly, several Pakistani \\n\\nenergy experts argue in a paper published by the Asian Development Bank Institute in 2018 \\n\\nthat the biggest obstacle to generating more electricity from wind and solar is the lack of \\n\\nadequate transmission and distribution infrastructure to absorb large amounts of power from \\n\\nintermittent sources of energy.60\\n\\nSecond, solar and wind were more expensive sources of electricity than coal when China \\n\\nand Pakistan launched CPEC, which made them a less attractive source of electricity than \\n\\ncoal to Islamabad given its goal of generating more a�ordable electricity. For most of 2015, \\n\\nfor example, the levelized tari� for new solar photovoltaic projects was between 14 and 15 \\n\\ncents per kilowatt hour, while the levelized tari� for a new wind project was between 13 and \\n\\n17 cents per kilowatt hour.62 In contrast, the levelized tari� for a new imported coal-based \\n\\npower plant was 8.6 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) and for a new domestic coal-based \\n\\npower plant was 9.7 cents/kWh. Today, however, wind and solar are the least expensive \\n\\nsources of new electricity in Pakistan. In 2018 levelized tari�s averaged 5.25 cents/kWh for \\n\\nsolar and 4.3 cents/kWh for wind while coal projects had levelized tari�s greater than 8 \\n\\ncents/kWh.63\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 21\\n\\n \\n\\nWhy are there no nuclear power plants in CPEC?\\n\\nNuclear power plants are not part of CPEC even though China virtually single-handedly \\n\\nbuilt Pakistan’s civilian nuclear program and continues to assist with its development. \\n\\nNuclear power plants are probably excluded from CPEC because China’s continued sale \\n\\nof reactors to Pakistan is perceived internationally to be a violation of the guidelines \\n\\nof the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which prohibits nuclear exports to nonmember \\n\\nstates unless they agree to full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards.64  \\n\\nWhen China joined the NSG in 2004, other members agreed to grandfather the \\n\\nconstruction of nuclear reactors in Pakistan for which contracts with China had been \\n\\ncompleted, including the Chashma-1 and Chashma-2 reactors.65 However, China \\n\\nsubsequently sold Pakistan the Chasma-3 and Chasma-4 reactors and is currently \\n\\nconstructing two nuclear reactors in Karachi.66 Beijing probably justifies its continued \\n\\nreactor sales to Pakistan on the basis of a bilateral agreement signed in 2003.67 However, \\n\\no�cials from the United States and other NSG members view these sales as inconsistent \\n\\nwith the NSG guidelines.68 As a result, Beijing may have pushed to exclude nuclear power \\n\\nplants from CPEC to avoid casting a pall over the initiative.69 \\n\\nIncentives for Foreign Investors\\n\\nThe government of Pakistan o�ers financial incentives to attract foreign companies to develop \\n\\ncoal mines in the Thar Desert and build coal power plants. Some of these incentives, such as \\n\\nhigh rates of return on equity and sovereign guarantees, are available to all foreign investors. \\n\\nOther incentives, notably Islamabad’s not yet fulfilled commitment to establish revolving \\n\\nfunds to ensure uninterrupted payments to power producers, are exclusive to Chinese firms.\\n\\nThe need for these incentives is reflected in the assessments of Chinese government agencies \\n\\nand power companies of the risks of doing business in Pakistan. For example, China’s State \\n\\nAdministration of Taxation states in its latest guidance to Chinese companies investing in \\n\\nPakistan that Pakistan’s external debt is huge, its ability to service this debt is very low, and that \\n\\nChina may become a high-risk creditor. It also noted that the returns on investment earned by \\n\\nChinese companies are very low.70 Chinese power companies have also identified numerous \\n\\nrisks to investing in Pakistan, notably the risk of delayed payments for electricity, which makes it \\n\\ndi�cult for companies operating power plants to purchase coal and repay lenders.71\\n\\nHigh Returns on Equity\\n\\nIslamabad increased the guaranteed return on equity (ROE) for coal-fired power plants to \\n\\nentice foreign investors, especially from China, to invest in Pakistan’s power sector.72 In June \\n\\n2013 NEPRA fixed the ROE for power projects based on local coal at 17 percent per year and \\n\\nthe ROE for power projects based on imported coal at 20 percent per year.73 NEPRA sets the \\n\\nROE for power projects because the ROE is one of several factors that determines the cost of \\n\\nelectricity.74 However, the failure of these rates to secure new investments prompted the now-\\n\\ndefunct Ministry of Water and Power to ask NEPRA in February 2014 to reconsider the tari�s, \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n22 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nand thus the ROEs, for coal power plants.75 In June 2014 NEPRA increased the ROE for coal \\n\\npower plants to 26.5–29.5 percent for local coal and to 24.5–27.2 percent for imported coal.76  \\n\\nThe following month, NEPRA set even higher ROEs of 30.65–34.49 percent for mine mouth \\n\\npower plants based on Thar coal (see table 4).77 In announcing the ROEs for Thar coal power \\n\\nplants, NEPRA noted that “Thar coal is a strategic energy resource, and investment in Thar has \\n\\nto be incentivized in order to expedite Thar coal development.

Islamabad \\n\\ninitially o�ered this incentive to CPEC coal power plants in April 2015 and subsequently \\n\\nextended it to all CPEC power projects in February 2016 as a result of concerns by Chinese \\n\\ninvestors about the risk of delayed payments.87 Specifically, the government of Pakistan \\n\\nagreed to create a fund equal to a minimum of 22 percent of estimated monthly power \\n\\npurchases. If the power purchaser defaults on payments, the government of Pakistan will \\n\\nassume the liability and pay the Chinese power producers.88 \\n\\nChinese o�cials and executives have indicated that Pakistan’s commitment to establish the \\n\\nrevolving fund, which has yet to be set up, helped facilitate Chinese investment in CPEC power \\n\\nprojects. Zhang Yuqing, a former deputy director of China’s National Energy Administration \\n\\nstated in a 2017 article that the revolving fund was one of several measures the government \\n\\nof Pakistan agreed to implement that led Chinese firms to assess that Pakistan’s investment \\n\\nenvironment had improved, which increased their enthusiasm for doing business there.89 \\n\\nSimilarly, an executive with PowerChina told the Chinese media that the biggest problem in \\n\\ninvesting in power stations in Pakistan is delayed payments and that PowerChina, together \\n\\nwith the National Energy Administration, pushed for the establishment of a revolving fund \\n\\nto be included in the intergovernmental agreement on CPEC energy cooperation to ensure \\n\\nuninterrupted payments to Chinese power producers.90 His remarks align with a Pakistani \\n\\npress report detailing that the Chinese refused to build any power plants until Islamabad \\n\\nagreed to protect Chinese investors and lenders from circular debt.91 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n24 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nThe “Push” from China\\n\\nIslamabad’s e�orts to increase the role of coal in Pakistan’s electricity mix aligned with the \\n\\nChinese government’s e�orts to partially alleviate excess capacity in a variety of industries, \\n\\nincluding coal power generation equipment, by encouraging Chinese companies to find new \\n\\nmarkets abroad. To this end, Beijing has called on Chinese financial institutions to support \\n\\nthe development of overseas power projects to drive the export of Chinese equipment. \\n\\nMoreover, the ability of Chinese firms and financial institutions to expedite the financing and \\n\\nconstruction of power plants aligned with former prime minister Sharif’s goal of bringing on a \\n\\nlarge volume of new generation capacity as quickly as possible.\\n\\nFind New Markets Abroad\\n\\nChinese firms are developing coal-fired power plants in Pakistan and other countries to generate \\n\\nnew sources of demand for coal power equipment in the face of constrained opportunities to \\n\\nexpand at home as China continues to green its electricity mix. Thermal’s share of China’s power \\n\\ngeneration capacity, most of which is coal, declined from 76 percent in 2008 to 62 percent in \\n\\n2017.92 Meanwhile, renewables have come to dominate new capacity installations. As a result, \\n\\nChinese manufacturers of coal power equipment are looking abroad for new markets, especially \\n\\nto countries rich in coal resources and short of generation capacity.\\n\\nChina’s production of generator sets, which are used in thermal, hydro, and nuclear power \\n\\nplants, is a case in point. The country produced far more generator sets than it installed \\n\\ndomestically over the past decade (see figure 3). The capacity of generator sets produced \\n\\nthat were actually installed declined from 62 percent in 2008 to 50 percent in 2017 before \\n\\nincreasing to 58 percent in 2018.93 The share of capacity of generator sets manufactured in \\n\\n2013 that were actually installed in that year was less than 50 percent.94 \\n\\nFigure 3: China’s generator set production exceeds new generation capacity \\n\\nSource: National Bureau of Statistics of China and China Electricity Council\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 25\\n\\nThis excess capacity is largely the result of the decline in coal and the rise of renewables in \\n\\nnew installations of power generation capacity in China. Thermal’s share of new installations \\n\\n(the majority of which were for coal power plants) dropped from 71 percent in 2008 to 33 \\n\\npercent in 2018.

China’s Eleventh Five-Year \\n\\nPlan (2006–2010) introduced for the first time a target of 10 percent for nonfossil energy \\n\\nconsumption.96 Beijing subsequently increased the nonfossil energy target to 11.4 percent in \\n\\nthe Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), to 15 percent in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016–\\n\\n2020), and to “around 20%” by 2030.97 The Chinese government is also considering requiring \\n\\nthat renewables account for at least 35 percent of China’s electricity consumption by 2030, \\n\\naccording to a draft plan viewed by Bloomberg in September 2018.98\\n\\nMeanwhile, major cities have also shuttered coal-fired power plants to improve air quality. The \\n\\nBeijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, for example, announced in August 2014 \\n\\nthat it would ban coal sales and use in Beijing’s six main districts by the end of 2020.99 The \\n\\ncity’s last coal-fired power plant closed in March 2017, making Beijing the first city in China to \\n\\nrely on cleaner energy sources, including nuclear, wind, and natural gas for power.100\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n26 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nChina’s excess capacity in generator sets is also partly the result of Beijing’s decision in \\n\\nOctober 2014 to devolve authority for permitting new coal-fired power plants to the provinces \\n\\nin a bid to cut bureaucratic red tape.101 Beijing had assumed that local governments would \\n\\nbe able to make faster and better decisions about new generation capacity based on their \\n\\ngreater understanding of local power demand. The provinces were quick to take advantage \\n\\nof their newfound authority, lured by the employment and tax revenue created by investment \\n\\nin fixed assets and aware that Beijing’s push to green China’s energy mix meant they had \\n\\na limited period to act. They granted permits to 210 new coal-fired power plants with a \\n\\ncombined capacity of 165 GW in 2015.102 Although Beijing subsequently canceled some of \\n\\nthese projects, the decentralization of permitting probably did result in the addition of new \\n\\ncoal-fired generation capacity that China did not need. For example, China’s new capacity \\n\\nadditions for coal-fired power generation increased from 35 GW in 2014 to 54 GW in 2015 and \\n\\nthen fell to 38.7 GW in 2016 and 35 GW in 2017.103\\n\\nThe Chinese government has encouraged Chinese manufacturers to export excess generator \\n\\nsets rather than warehouse them. This push to sell more generation equipment abroad is in \\n\\nline with Beijing’s preference for partially alleviating industrial overcapacity through exports. \\n\\nFor example, the “Guiding Opinions on Resolving the Contradiction of Serious Overcapacity” \\n\\n(“Guiding Opinions on Overcapacity”), released in October 2013, calls on Chinese firms to \\n\\nundertake major infrastructure and industrial projects overseas to drive the export of Chinese \\n\\nequipment, technology, products, standards, and services.104 Similarly, the State Council’s \\n\\n“Guiding Opinions on the Promotion of International Production Capacity and Equipment \\n\\nManufacturing Cooperation” (“Guiding Opinions on International Production Capacity”), \\n\\npublished in May 2015, states that overseas projects should be vigorously developed to \\n\\nenlarge China’s export of power equipment and technology, with thermal and hydropower \\n\\nprojects discussed first.105 When Premier Li Keqiang visited the Guangdong Electric Power \\n\\nand Design Research Institute in January 2015, he stated that it is necessary for China’s \\n\\npower sector to lead the globalization of China’s equipment industry not only because of \\n\\novercapacity in generation equipment but also because China’s technologies are advanced.106 \\n\\nThe CPEC power sector projects are driving the export of Chinese equipment. For example, \\n\\nChinese firms manufactured 99 percent of the equipment used in the Port Qasim coal power \\n\\nplant, including the steam turbines, boilers, and generators. The construction of the power \\n\\nplant drove the export of more than RMB 7 billion ($1.1 billion) worth of equipment, making it a \\n\\n“model project” for the export of Chinese standards, equipment, and technology according to \\n\\nthe China Power News Network.107 Similarly, the Hub coal power plant is expected to drive the \\n\\nexport of $900 million of equipment, including boiler systems, fuel systems, and circulating \\n\\nwater systems.108\\n\\nMeanwhile, the State Grid Corporation of China is building it first overseas ±660 kV high-\\n\\nvoltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line in Pakistan between Matiari and Lahore, \\n\\nwhich will evacuate electricity produced by seven CPEC coal power plants.109 The project uses \\n\\nthe company’s direct current technology. Nearly 80 percent of the project adopts China’s \\n\\ntechnical standards, which State Grid estimates will drive RMB 6.7 billion (around US$ 1 billion) \\n\\nof equipment and technology service exports.110\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 27\\n\\nFinancial Support\\n\\nAnother reason Chinese power companies and banks are developing coal power plants is \\n\\nthe financial support provided by Chinese financial institutions.

Beijing’s guidance is contained in government \\n\\ndocuments and speeches made by Xi Jinping. The State Council’s “Guiding Opinions on \\n\\nOvercapacity” calls for increased debt financing to support international expansion in \\n\\novercapacity industries.111 Its “Guiding Opinions on International Production Capacity” \\n\\nsimilarly encourages Chinese financial institutions, especially policy banks such as the China \\n\\nDevelopment Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), to provide \\n\\nadditional financing for overseas projects that will drive exports of Chinese equipment, \\n\\nincluding power generation equipment. The document also calls for strengthening and \\n\\nimproving export credit insurance to facilitate the export of large-scale, complete sets of \\n\\nequipment, which presumably includes turnkey power plants.112\\n\\nMore broadly, President Xi announced an additional $113 billion in financial support at the Belt \\n\\nand Road Forum in Beijing in May 2017.113 The $113 billion includes $69.5 billion of additional \\n\\nfunds for the Silk Road Fund, China Development Bank, and China Eximbank. (Specifically, \\n\\nXi said that “China” will contribute $14.5 billion to the Silk Road Fund and that the China \\n\\nDevelopment Bank and China Eximbank will establish special BRI funds in the amounts of \\n\\n$36.2 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively.) Xi also encouraged financial institutions to deploy \\n\\nthe equivalent of $43.5 billion in Chinese currency to help develop the BRI.\\n\\nChinese state-owned financial institutions are supporting the development of overseas \\n\\ncoal-fired power plants in line with Beijing’s guidance.114 As of July 2018, Chinese banks and \\n\\nfirms had committed or provided funding for more than 25 percent of all coal plants under \\n\\ndevelopment outside of China. Pakistan was the fourth largest recipient of Chinese financing \\n\\nfor coal power plants behind Bangladesh, Vietnam, and South Africa. The principal Chinese \\n\\nfinanciers include policy banks (institutions with a mandate to support Beijing’s policy \\n\\npriorities) such as the China Development Bank and China Eximbank and commercial banks \\n\\nsuch as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Bank of China.\\n\\nWhile China’s policy and commercial banks feature prominently in discussions of Chinese \\n\\nfinancing for coal-fired power plants, the Chinese financial institution that arguably plays \\n\\nthe most important role in facilitating the development of overseas coal power plants is the \\n\\nstate-owned China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, known as Sinosure. It is China’s \\n\\nonly o�cial export guarantee agency. Sinosure has a mandate to promote Chinese equipment \\n\\nexports and overseas investment through the provision of insurance against nonpayment and \\n\\neconomic losses due to risks including war, expropriation, and breach of contract.115 Sinosure \\n\\ncovers up to 95 percent of the equity, debt, or deferred payment.116\\n\\nChina requires Chinese financial institutions and state-owned enterprises to obtain insurance \\n\\nfrom Sinosure before lending and making investments overseas.117 Sinosure guarantees \\n\\nare likely to be especially important for coal power projects, which can cost hundreds of \\n\\nmillions of dollars to develop and thus are a significant credit risk to lenders.118 Sinosure has \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n28 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nunderwritten 11 power sector projects in Pakistan with an insured amount of $14.92 billion.119  \\n\\nNEPRA has allowed a Sinosure fee of up to 7 percent of the total debt servicing to be included \\n\\nin the project cost used to calculate the tari�s for all CPEC power generation projects.120\\n\\nSinosure is one of the reasons Chinese firms are developing coal power projects in Pakistan. \\n\\nThe Port Qasim coal power plant is a case in point. Even though the government of Pakistan \\n\\nprovided a sovereign guarantee for the power purchase agreement, PowerChina was \\n\\nconcerned that Islamabad might not be able to honor its guarantee because of the Pakistani \\n\\npower sector’s debt.121 Consequently, Sinosure agreed to underwrite delayed payments from \\n\\nPakistan; if the government of Pakistan is unable to reimburse in a timely fashion the project \\n\\ncompany jointly owned by PowerChina and Qatar’s Al Mirqab Capital for power purchases, the \\n\\ncompany can file a claim with Sinosure for breach of contract.122 \\n\\nThe Need for Speed\\n\\nThe large share of coal-fired capacity in CPEC power projects is also consistent with the \\n\\npriority former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif placed on bringing online as much \\n\\nnew generation capacity as fast as possible to make good on his pledge to end Pakistan’s \\n\\nelectricity shortages before he stood for reelection in 2018.123 Chinese companies can build \\n\\ncoal power plants very quickly, even in as short a time frame as less than a year.124 Moreover, \\n\\ncoordination between Chinese financiers and power companies expedited the financing for \\n\\nCPEC power projects.\\n\\nChinese companies met Sharif’s need for speed on some projects. PowerChina, the firm that \\n\\nbuilt the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant, hung floodlights from cranes so construction could \\n\\ncontinue at night.125 The company completed the project in just 22 months, 200 days ahead of \\n\\nschedule, setting a record for the shortest construction period for this type of unit abroad.126  \\n\\nThe Pakistani government reportedly regarded the speed at which the Sahiwal plant was \\n\\nconstructed as a miracle in the history of Pakistan’s electric power construction.127 \\n\\nPowerChina came under pressure from the Pakistani government to rapidly develop the Port \\n\\nQasim coal-fired plant. According to one Chinese media report, the biggest “roadblock” \\n\\nPowerChina faced in completing the project was the requirement from Islamabad to reduce \\n\\nthe construction period from 48 months to 42 months and then to 36 months.128 PowerChina \\n\\nexecutives spoke about the di�culty of satisfying this request in interviews with Chinese \\n\\njournalists. The chairman of the Port Qasim Electric Power Company, a subsidiary of \\n\\nPowerChina, noted that the average construction time globally for a plant the size of Port \\n\\nQasim was 42 months.129 In another interview, the chairman of PowerChina, Yan Zhiyong, \\n\\nrevealed that during negotiations over the project, the Pakistanis asked PowerChina if it \\n\\ncould complete the plant and connect it to the grid six months ahead of schedule in light of \\n\\nthe country’s power shortages and the 2018 elections. Chairman Yan responded, “from the \\n\\nperspective of a politician, I understand this request very well. But from the perspective of an \\n\\nengineer and from the perspective of the chairman of a central state-owned enterprise and \\n\\nglobal Fortune 500 company, I must responsibly tell you that this request is impossible to \\n\\nachieve.”130 Nonetheless, PowerChina connected the plant’s two generating units to the grid \\n\\nin just 32 months. The Port Qasim coal power project began commercial operation 67 days \\n\\nahead of schedule on April 25, 2018, three months before Pakistan’s general election.131 \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 29\\n\\nThe ability of Chinese companies to execute projects quickly was a factor in Pakistan’s \\n\\nselection of a Chinese firm to build a major transmission line. The Pakistani government \\n\\nawarded the contract for the Matiari-Lahore HVDC line to State Grid over GE, even though \\n\\nGE’s initial cost estimate was two-thirds that of State Grid ($800 million versus $1.26 billion), \\n\\nbecause the Chinese company said it could complete the project in 27 months.132 When \\n\\nIslamabad asked Western companies to match State Grid’s timeline, the companies said it \\n\\nwould take at least 48 months to complete the project.133\\n\\nAccording to Zhang Yuqing, former deputy director of China’s National Energy \\n\\nAdministration, coordination between Chinese financial institutions and power companies \\n\\nenabled CPEC power projects to secure financing in a timely fashion, which helped accelerate \\n\\ntheir development. Chinese banks and Sinosure participated in planning and negotiating the \\n\\nCPEC power projects from the very start.134 In the case of the Hub coal-fired power plant, \\n\\nthe project secured financing so quickly that it was reportedly viewed as a “miracle” by the \\n\\noutside world.135 Similarly, the integration of the financing for the Thar Block II coal mine and \\n\\npower plant helped expedite the approval of the project within China.136 \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n30 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nAnalysts have raised concerns about the likelihood of infrastructure being developed as part of \\n\\nthe BRI adversely a�ecting the environment. Infrastructure likely to have the greatest impact \\n\\non the environment include roads and railways; thermal, hydro, and nuclear power plants; \\n\\nelectricity transmission systems; oil and natural gas pipelines; mining projects; and heavy \\n\\nindustry.  The risks associated with these infrastructure projects include increased air and water \\n\\npollution, habitat loss and fragmentation, deforestation, greater wildlife mortality, the threat \\n\\nof invasive species; and increased greenhouse gas emissions that undermine global action to \\n\\ncombat climate change.138 Ma Jun and Simon Zadek of Tsinghua University have warned that \\n\\nBRI countries could account for more than 50 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions by \\n\\n2050 in the worst-case scenario.139\\n\\nCoal power plants often feature prominently in discussions of the environmental sustainability \\n\\nof the BRI because they account for a large share of the power generation projects being \\n\\ndeveloped and financed by Chinese entities in BRI countries. A study by the World Resources \\n\\nInstitute finds that Chinese debt financing for power generation and transmission projects in \\n\\nBRI countries is skewed toward coal. Specifically, in 2014–2017, 40 percent (or $10.2 billion) of \\n\\nsyndicated loans for such projects involving at least one of six major Chinese banks was used \\n\\nto finance coal-fired power plants.140 Moreover, Fitch Solutions expects coal power projects \\n\\nto remain a core focus of generation projects developed under the BRI. According to its \\n\\ncalculations in 2018, coal accounts for 52 percent (or 80 GW) of the 153 GW capacity in its BRI \\n\\npower project pipeline.141\\n\\nThe CPEC coal power plants pose several threats to Pakistan’s environment. First, they will \\n\\nincrease substantially Pakistan’s greenhouse gas emissions, which is likely to complicate \\n\\nPakistan’s pledge, made at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \\n\\nParis in December 2015, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.142 Second, new coal power \\n\\nplants risk exacerbating Pakistan’s water scarcity because mining coal and burning it for power \\n\\ngeneration are water-intensive activities.143 Third, CPEC coal power plants may create health \\n\\nproblems from increased emissions of air pollutants and the handling and disposal of coal ash, \\n\\nwhich contains carcinogens.144\\n\\nThe production of Thar coal for power generation also threatens the local environment. The \\n\\nThar Desert contains lignite coal, which has a lower heating value than bituminous coal. This \\n\\nmeans that more coal must be burned to produce a given amount of power, which means more \\n\\npollutants, including greenhouse gases, are generated.145 Some residents of Thar have worried \\n\\nthat the projects will contaminate and deplete their water supplies, destroy the local ecology, \\n\\nand result in a loss of trees and grazing lands.146\\n\\nConsequently, most CPEC power projects are out of line with Beijing’s pledge to build a green \\n\\nBRI. The Chinese government has highlighted green development as a goal of the BRI. In \\n\\nAugust 2016 six central government agencies, including the People’s Bank of China, released \\n\\n“Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System,” which calls on Chinese banks, firms, \\n\\nPART 2: CPEC AND ENVIRONMENTAL \\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 31\\n\\nand multilateral development banks in which China actively participates to adopt green \\n\\nfinancing and strengthen environmental risk management for BRI projects.147 In May 2017 \\n\\nChina’s Ministry of Environmental Protection, Ministry of Foreign A�airs, National Development \\n\\nand Reform Commission, and Ministry of Commerce jointly issued “Guidance on Promoting \\n\\nGreen Belt and Road,” which aims to align the BRI with the trend of “green, low carbon and \\n\\ncircular development.”148 Later that month, President Xi himself stated at the opening ceremony \\n\\nof the inaugural Belt and Road Forum that “We need to seize opportunities presented by the \\n\\nnew round of change in the energy mix and the revolution in energy technologies to develop \\n\\nglobal energy interconnection and achieve low-carbon development.”149 In November 2018 \\n\\nChina’s special representative on climate change, Xie Zhenhua, told journalists that the central \\n\\ngovernment has made clear that BRI projects should be green and follow a low-carbon path.150  \\n\\nXi recommitted to using the BRI to promote green development at the second Belt and Road \\n\\nForum in April 2019.151\\n\\nWhat explains the disconnect?\\n\\nThe CPEC power projects indicate that the disconnect between Beijing’s green BRI rhetoric \\n\\nand the reality on the ground can be explained by two factors. First, it is ultimately up to a \\n\\nhost country to determine its power generation mix, and Chinese o�cials and power company \\n\\nexecutives may be reluctant to interfere in the decision-making process. Second, some of the \\n\\nChinese firms developing coal power plants abroad maintain they are clean, especially if they \\n\\nproduce less emissions than the alternatives.\\n\\nHost Country Preferences\\n\\nThe CPEC power projects highlight the importance of host country preferences in determining \\n\\nthe composition of their power generation mixes. Chinese firms would not be building so many \\n\\ncoal-fired power plants overseas without a large customer base abroad. China can’t force other \\n\\ncountries to buy power generation equipment they do not want. Although Chinese companies \\n\\ncertainly have a strong incentive to sell excess thermal power generation sets overseas, they \\n\\nalso had an eager buyer in Pakistan. The country had been courting foreign investors, including \\n\\nChinese firms, to invest in the development of the Thar coal fields long before Beijing and \\n\\nIslamabad decided to launch CPEC.152 Given that Chinese firms can build other types of power \\n\\nplants and that Beijing is promoting the export of wind turbines and solar panels along with \\n\\nthermal and hydropower generation equipment, it is plausible that if Pakistan had prioritized the \\n\\ndevelopment of renewable energy projects, the composition of the generation mix of the CPEC \\n\\npower plants would be di�erent.153 The dominance of coal in the generation mix of the CPEC \\n\\npower plants may also reflect a reluctance on the part of the Chinese government to dictate \\n\\nthe environmental policies of other countries even though China certainly has the financial \\n\\nresources and expertise in building solar, wind, and hydropower projects to help countries to \\n\\nshift their generation mixes in a greener direction.\\n\\nImran Khan’s election as Pakistan’s prime minister in July 2018 prompted Chinese o�cials to \\n\\nrea�rm Pakistan’s leading role in determining CPEC’s trajectory. Indeed, China’s ambassador \\n\\nto Pakistan, Yao Jing, has indicated that it is ultimately up to Pakistan to decide what type of \\n\\nprojects are included in CPEC. In an interview with Reuters in September 2018, he said that \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n32 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nBeijing would definitely follow the agenda of the new government of Prime Minister Imran \\n\\nKhan to develop a road map for BRI projects and would only move forward with projects \\n\\nPakistan wanted. “This is Pakistan’s economy, this is their society,” he said.154 That same month \\n\\nChina’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, said that “in terms of how we advance the construction in \\n\\nthe next stage [of CPEC], we will always respect the will of the Pakistani side.”155\\n\\nKhan is shifting the focus of CPEC away from projects aimed at fulfilling his predecessor’s \\n\\npromise to end power outages and toward projects in line with his campaign pledge to boost \\n\\nsocial spending.156 The outcomes of the meeting of CPEC’s Joint Cooperation Committee in \\n\\nBeijing in December 2018 reflect Khan’s priorities. The Pakistanis requested that the proposed \\n\\n1,320 MW Rahim Yar Khan imported coal-based power plant be removed from CPEC because \\n\\nPakistan had already contracted su�cient generation capacity and more contract would \\n\\nresult in a “capacity trap.” (The project had already been deleted from the list of CPEC energy \\n\\npriority projects after Islamabad announced a ban on new power plants using imported fuels \\n\\nin June 2016.)157 In addition, the two countries agreed to expand CPEC to include industrial, \\n\\nagricultural, and socioeconomic projects. The Chinese also committed to providing a grant of \\n\\n$1 billion for projects in areas including education, health, and irrigation.158 \\n\\nSeeing Green\\n\\nThe disconnect between the large number of coal power plants under development with \\n\\nChinese financing in Pakistan and Beijing’s emphasis on building a green BRI may also be \\n\\nexplained by the fact that at least some of the CPEC coal power plants, notably those built \\n\\nat Port Qasim and Sahiwal and under construction at Hub, are viewed as “green” in China. \\n\\nPowerChina, which is involved in all three plants as an owner or builder, has touted their \\n\\ngreen credentials. For example, one executive told the Pakistani media that the company \\n\\nhad adopted the highest international standards and most modern technology to ensure the \\n\\nproduction of clean energy at the Port Qasim plant.159 Similarly, an article on PowerChina’s \\n\\nwebsite states that the Sahiwal power plant “has the highest operation e�ciency, most \\n\\nadvanced technologies and is the most environmentally-friendly of any coal-fired plant in the \\n\\ncountry.”160 Wang Binghua, the chairman of PowerChina’s parent company, China State Power \\n\\nInvestment Corporation, said that the company is adopting “top international technologies \\n\\non environment protection” at Hub, explaining that “we are adopting a super clean emission \\n\\ntechnology which could make the emissions at the plant the same as a gas fired power plant.”161\\n\\nWhile PowerChina certainly has an incentive to portray its coal-fired power plants in Pakistan \\n\\nas green to counter criticisms about the environmental risks posed by these projects, there \\n\\nis some truth in the company’s statements. First, all three plants use supercritical power \\n\\ngeneration technology.162 Coal plants are categorized as subcritical, supercritical, or ultra-\\n\\nsupercritical depending on how e�ciently they burn coal to generate electricity. Supercritical \\n\\nplants emit less carbon dioxide than subcritical plants but more than ultra-supercritical \\n\\nplants.163 Second, the Port Qasim and Sahiwal plants also have advanced pollution abatement \\n\\nequipment, such as flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) \\n\\nto reduce sulfur and nitrogen emissions and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), which control \\n\\nparticulate emissions, while the Hub plant has ESPs and FGD and the option to add SCR.164\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 33\\n\\nThird, the supercritical coal plants being developed as part of CPEC should emit fewer \\n\\ngreenhouse gasses than the fuel oil plants that Pakistan is seeking to replace with the coal-\\n\\nfired ones. Indeed, the Asian Development Bank, which is financing the construction of a \\n\\n600 MW supercritical coal-fired unit at the Jamshoro Thermal Power Station, stated that \\n\\nsupercritical coal plants emit fewer greenhouse gases than Pakistan’s existing heavy-fuel-oil-\\n\\nfired plants.165  According to the Asian Development Bank, the new supercritical coal-fired unit \\n\\nat Jamshoro will emit 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour compared to the 930 \\n\\ngrams of carbon dioxide emitted by the existing heavy fuel oil unit at Jamshoro.166\\n\\nHowever, other CPEC coal power plants are less environmentally friendly, especially from a \\n\\nclimate perspective.167 Three of the Thar coal plants and the Gwadar coal power plant use—or \\n\\nwill use—subcritical technology (see table 5). As a result, these four plants will emit a lot more \\n\\ncarbon dioxide per unit of electricity. The Gwadar coal power plant should be as clean from a \\n\\ntraditional pollutant perspective as a supercritical plant if all the planned pollution abatement \\n\\nequipment, including FGD, ESP, and SCR, is installed and run well.168 \\n\\nTable 5: Generation technologies of CPEC coal power plants \\n\\nSources: See Appendix A. \\n\\n \\n\\nIt’s worth noting that Pakistan’s appetite for additional subcritical coal plants may be limited. In \\n\\nJuly 2017 NEPRA announced that its new upfront tari� for Thar coal power plants will only be \\n\\navailable to projects that use supercritical technology or above and that the use of subcritical \\n\\ntechnology would not be allowed.169 As a result of this new tari� policy, Oracle Power expanded \\n\\nthe size of its planned power plant in Thar Block IV from 1,320 MW to 1,400 MW to comply with \\n\\nthe new requirement to apply supercritical technology.170 \\n\\nCoal power plant Generation technology\\n\\nPort Qasim coal power plant Supercritical\\n\\nSahiwal coal power plant Supercritical\\n\\nEngro Thar Block II coal power project Subcritical\\n\\nTEL Thar Block II coal power project Subcritical\\n\\nThalnova Thar Block II coal power project Subcritical\\n\\nGwadar coal power project Subcritical\\n\\nSSRL Thar Block I coal power project Supercritical\\n\\nHub coal power plant Supercritical\\n\\nThar Mine Mouth Oracle power plant Supercritical\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n34 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nThe BRI has generated concerns about whether Chinese loans for infrastructure development \\n\\nwill create debt problems in borrowing countries. A frequently cited analysis of the debt \\n\\nimplications published by the Center on Global Development in March 2018 found that the \\n\\nBRI increases the risk of debt distress in some borrowing countries.171 International Monetary \\n\\nFund (IMF) o�cials have also warned of the risks to debt sustainability posed by the BRI. \\n\\nChristine Lagarde, a former managing director of the IMF, cautioned in remarks in Beijing \\n\\nin April 2018 against the financing of unneeded and unsustainable infrastructure and urged \\n\\ncareful management of financing terms in countries where public debt is already high.172 \\n\\nMaurice Obstfeld, economic counselor at the IMF, o�ered similar advice about China’s \\n\\nfinancing of infrastructure in Pakistan at a press conference in October 2018. He noted that \\n\\nalthough Pakistan needs more infrastructure, “it is important that the design of projects, \\n\\nthe governance of projects be sound and that excessive debts which cannot be repaid are \\n\\navoided because that just leads to financial instability and lower growth.”173\\n\\nSome observers maintain that China is intentionally attempting to saddle countries with \\n\\nunsustainable levels of debt in order to gain control of strategic infrastructure or political \\n\\ninfluence when borrowing countries can’t repay their loans. For example, in August 2018, \\n\\nRay Washburne, president of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, said that \\n\\nChina’s “projects economically don’t make a lot of sense. It’s a loan-to-own program the \\n\\nChinese are doing.”174 That same month, a group of US senators sent a letter to Treasury \\n\\nSecretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo expressing concern about \\n\\npotential bailout requests to the IMF by countries that have “accepted predatory Chinese \\n\\ninfrastructure financing” and stating that China “attempts to hold other countries financially \\n\\nhostage and force ransoms that further its geostrategic goals.”175 The senators also warned \\n\\nthat China might use debt as leverage to establish naval bases in countries unable to repay \\n\\nloans where Chinese firms hold concession agreements to operate and develop ports, \\n\\nincluding Pakistan and Sri Lanka.176 \\n\\nPakistan frequently appears in discussions of the debt sustainability of the BRI because of \\n\\nthe country’s heavy and increasing debt burden. Pakistan’s debt-to-GDP ratio increased from \\n\\n70 percent in 2017 to 75.3 percent in 2018 and is projected by the IMF to reach a high of 80.5 \\n\\npercent in 2020. Research indicates that countries with rising debt-to-GDP ratios above 50–60 \\n\\npercent are at greater risk of default or debt treatment.181 Pakistan’s debt is partly the result of \\n\\nborrowing from China. According to an IMF report published in July 2019, Chinese bilateral and \\n\\ncommercial loans accounted for 26 percent of Pakistan’s total outstanding debt of $85.5 billion.182 \\n\\nPakistan turned to the IMF in October 2018 to avoid a default.183 In July 2019 the IMF’s \\n\\nexecutive board approved a 39-month bailout package in the amount of $6 billion that \\n\\nwill unlock around $38.6 billion in support from Pakistan’s international partners over the \\n\\nthree-year period.184 The IMF expects Pakistan’s external debt to remain sustainable due to \\n\\na projected fall in external borrowing after Pakistan’s fiscal year 2021 and the commitments \\n\\nfrom Pakistan’s international partners.185 \\n\\nPART 3: CPEC AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 35\\n\\n \\n\\nHambantota Port’s central role in the “debt trap diplomacy” narrative\\n\\nProponents of the argument that China is practicing debt trap diplomacy to seize \\n\\nstrategic assets tend to focus on a single example, Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka, despite \\n\\nChina’s established track record of waiving or restructuring loans without taking control \\n\\nof assets.177 The government of Sri Lanka’s previous president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who \\n\\nwas in o�ce from 2005 to 2015, borrowed money from China to build infrastructure in \\n\\nhis hometown of Hambantota, including a port.178  Struggling to repay Sri Lanka’s loans, \\n\\nthe government of Rajapaksa’s successor, Maithripala Sirisena, broached the idea of an \\n\\nequity swap for some of its debt to China. During then Sri Lankan prime minister Ranil \\n\\nWickremesinghe’s visit to Beijing in April 2016, he told reporters “we’ve been talking \\n\\nwith some companies and also the government of China about the possibility of some \\n\\ninfrastructure projects becoming public-private partnerships, in which part of the \\n\\ndebt will become equity held by Chinese companies.”179 In 2017 China Merchants Port \\n\\nHoldings (CMPH) became the majority shareholder in a joint venture with Sri Lanka Ports \\n\\nAuthority that holds a concession to develop and operate the port for 99 years. CMPH \\n\\npaid the Sri Lanka Ports Authority $1.12 billion for the joint venture stake. 180  \\n\\nSovereign Debt Risks from CPEC Power Projects\\n\\nConcerns that the CPEC power sector projects may increase Pakistan’s sovereign debt are \\n\\nvalid for two reasons. First, the government of Pakistan has issued sovereign guarantees to \\n\\nCPEC power producers for payments from the country’s sole buyer of electricity, the Central \\n\\nPower Purchasing Authority (CPPA) and to the lenders to a coal mine and power plant being \\n\\ndeveloped under CPEC. Second, the CPEC power plants may increase the circular debt in \\n\\nPakistan’s power sector, which the government may pay o� based on past practice.\\n\\nIn theory, CPEC power sector projects should not increase the Pakistani government’s debt \\n\\nburden—if consumers pay their bills in full—because the government is not borrowing money \\n\\nto finance these projects. Instead, Chinese and other financial institutions are lending money \\n\\nto special purpose companies (SPCs) established to develop the projects. Most of these \\n\\nSPCs are majority owned by Chinese firms (see table 6). For example, the International and \\n\\nCommercial Bank of China is the head of a syndicate that agreed to provide $1.44 billion \\n\\nto Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Ltd., an SPC owned by China’s Huaneng Shandong \\n\\nPower and Shandong Ruyi Group that developed and operates the Sahiwal coal-fired power \\n\\nplant.

Some of \\n\\nthese sovereign guarantees support the payment obligations of power the purchaser, the \\n\\nCPPA, to the power producers.187 As discussed above, if consumers do not pay the distribution \\n\\ncompanies in full, the distribution companies will not have enough money to pay the CPPA, \\n\\nwhich will not have enough money to pay the power producers. Under the sovereign \\n\\nguarantee, in the event of a default of payments by the CPPA leading to the termination of the \\n\\npower purchase agreement between the power producer and the CPPA, the power producer \\n\\ncan exercise a put option to sell its power plant and recover its investment and return on \\n\\ninvestment from the government of Pakistan.\\n\\nAnother risk to Pakistan’s debt sustainability posed by CPEC projects to which Islamabad has \\n\\nissued a sovereign guarantee to the lenders is the fact that the majority of the loans made \\n\\nby Chinese financial institutions to the companies operating the CPEC power plants are in \\n\\nforeign currencies, mostly US dollars.188 If there is an external shock that results in a substantial \\n\\ndevaluation of Pakistan’s currency (which Islamabad devalued five times in 2018 alone), then \\n\\notherwise well-performing power plants may become financially unviable.189 As the Pakistani \\n\\nrupee devalues, the cost domestically of servicing the debt increases and the risk of default \\n\\nalso increases because the loans to the project companies are in foreign currency and the \\n\\npower projects are earning revenue in Pakistani rupees. (This risk applies to the Engro Thar \\n\\nBlock II integrated coal mine and power plant, for which the government of Pakistan issued \\n\\na sovereign guarantee in the amount of $700 million to the consortiums of Chinese and \\n\\nPakistani banks that are providing $1.5 billion to help finance the project.190)\\n\\nExternal shocks are one of the primary reasons that countries develop external debt \\n\\nproblems. For example, during the East Asian Financial Crisis of 1997–1998, the decline \\n\\n(and eventual reversal) of capital flows to the region resulted to currency devaluations. The \\n\\ndevaluations caused the size of external debt, measured in terms of domestic currency, to \\n\\nsuddenly balloon. The inability of private sector borrowers to service foreign currency debts, \\n\\nwhich resulted in widespread financial distress and even bankruptcies, contributed to the \\n\\ndecision of Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea to seek financial support from the IMF and \\n\\nother multilateral financial institutions.191\\n\\nFinally, the CPEC power plants may increase Pakistan’s sovereign debt by increasing the \\n\\ncircular debt in Pakistan’s power sector. Electricity generated by new power plants—regardless \\n\\nof whether they are part of CPEC—is likely to increase circular debt if the percentage of \\n\\ntransmission and distribution losses remain constant and electricity consumption and bills \\n\\nincrease.192 When circular debt among power sector stakeholders becomes unsustainable, \\n\\nthe government steps in to either repay the growing debts of the sector or engages in \\n\\ngovernment borrowing to reduce the debts (or both). For example, the government of former \\n\\nprime minister Nawaz Sharif paid o� cleared circular debt of $4.8 billion after coming to \\n\\npower in June 2013.193 More recently, in March 2019, the government of Prime Minister Imran \\n\\nKhan raised $1.44 billion from Islamic banks to reduce circular debt.194 \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n38 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nDeliberate Debt Trap Unlikely\\n\\nIt seems unlikely that Chinese banks and firms are developing power plants in Pakistan for the \\n\\npurpose of trapping the country in debt. After all, as some analysts have noted, there is no \\n\\nevidence that Beijing has such a strategy.195 Moreover, several features of the China-Pakistan \\n\\nrelationship, the stake the Chinese government and companies have in sustainable CPEC \\n\\nprojects, and the involvement of non-Chinese firms and banks in some of the CPEC power \\n\\nprojects suggest that these projects are not part of a Chinese plan to generate problematic \\n\\nincreases in Pakistan’s sovereign debt.\\n\\nFirst, an attempt by China to intentionally weaken Pakistan’s economy would risk undermining \\n\\nthe broader China-Pakistan relationship. Leaders from both countries speak of the bilateral \\n\\nrelationship in glowing terms, characterizing it as “higher than the Himalayas, deeper than \\n\\nthe ocean and sweeter than the sweetest honey.”196 According to Andrew Small, an expert on \\n\\nChina-Pakistan relations at the German Marshall Fund, the bilateral relationship is supported \\n\\nby favorable views of China across the political system and with the general public. Indeed, \\n\\na poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in 2015 found that Pakistan had the most \\n\\nfavorable views of China (besides China itself) out of 40 countries surveyed, with 82 percent \\n\\nof Pakistanis surveyed holding a favorable opinion of China.197 If Pakistan’s political elites and \\n\\npopulation were to perceive China as intentionally seeking to harm Pakistan’s economy, this \\n\\nperception would likely undercut public support for a strong relationship with China and make \\n\\nthe Pakistani government less responsive to Chinese interests.198\\n\\nSecond, saddling Islamabad with an unsustainable debt burden runs counter to Beijing’s \\n\\ninterest in a more prosperous and stable Pakistan.199 The Chinese government likely regards \\n\\ngreater economic prosperity in Pakistan as benefiting China by enabling Pakistan to more \\n\\ne�ectively address challenges to China’s security from inside and outside of Pakistan’s \\n\\nborders. Beijing is concerned about Pakistan’s role as a hub for growing militance in South \\n\\nAsia, which creates an enabling environment for extremist groups, including ones that have \\n\\nthreatened China.200 There is a sense in China that a stronger economy could ease such \\n\\nthreats by generating more resources for law and order and creating more employment \\n\\nopportunities.201 Similarly, a more prosperous and stable Pakistan enhances its ability to serve \\n\\nas a counterweight to India.202\\n\\nThird, deep ties between the Chinese and Pakistani militaries make it unlikely that China would \\n\\nhave to resort to using debt as a source of leverage to pressure Pakistan to grant China’s navy \\n\\ngreater access to Pakistani ports or establish a base. After all, military relations are the core \\n\\nof the bilateral relationship.203 China has been Pakistan’s only reliable weapons supplier and \\n\\nhas helped Pakistan develop ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons.204 Moreover, China’s navy \\n\\nalready has access to Karachi, which it visited 10 times between 2008 and 2017.205 \\n\\nFourth, China’s support for the IMF’s latest program for Pakistan is another indicator that \\n\\nBeijing is not deliberately seeking to create a problematic increase in Pakistan’s debt. China \\n\\nis the largest contributor to the $17.5 billion that the IMF program has mobilized from key \\n\\nbilateral partners and multilateral development banks for the first 12 months of the 39-month \\n\\nbailout package providing $6.3 billion.206 It is IMF sta� and management that have the \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 39\\n\\nmost leverage over Pakistan because they set Pakistan’s borrowing ceilings and targets \\n\\nfor budgetary and monetary policy.207 Moreover, China has agreed to ensure that any new \\n\\nfinancing it provides to Pakistan is consistent with the debt sustainability objectives of the \\n\\nIMF program.208\\n\\nFifth, if the CPEC power projects were to push Pakistan into a debt crisis, such an outcome \\n\\nwould likely tarnish the image of the BRI, an outcome China’s government wants to avoid. \\n\\nBeijing’s release of a debt sustainability framework for BRI projects at the Belt and Road \\n\\nForum in April 2019 reflects both concern in Beijing about the “debt trap diplomacy” narrative \\n\\nand an e�ort to support sustainable projects.209 To be sure, one of the reasons Beijing \\n\\npublished the framework is to rebu� international criticism of Chinese lending practices.210  \\n\\nHowever, the development of the framework, which the ministry of finance says is based \\n\\non the IMF/World Bank debt sustainability framework for low-income countries, appears \\n\\nto reflect an e�ort to understand and promote debt sustainability.211 According to Christine \\n\\nLagarde, the IMF worked with the Chinese “for weeks and weeks…to explain how debt \\n\\nsustainability matters.”212\\n\\nIn addition, the Chinese companies developing the CPEC power sector projects are probably \\n\\naware that the sustainability of these projects may have implications for their ability to \\n\\nexpand into other overseas markets. For example, Shanghai Electric, which is involved in \\n\\nthe construction of a mine mouth power plant in Thar Block I, stated in a filing with the \\n\\nHong Kong Stock Exchange that “being the Company’s first general contracting project on \\n\\ncoal-fired supercritical units in the international market, this would lay the foundation for \\n\\nthe Company to explore its overseas market on supercritical coal-fired power generation \\n\\nequipment.”213 Similarly, PowerChina apparently intends for the Sahiwal coal power plant to \\n\\nhelp it attract additional business abroad. According to a Chinese energy industry publication, \\n\\nthe PowerChina employees who built the plant maintain that “the quality of overseas projects \\n\\nis the best international business card.”214\\n\\nSixth, the participation of non-Chinese entities in CPEC power projects suggests that other \\n\\nactors expect these projects to be sustainable. For example, the World Bank’s International \\n\\nFinance Corporation (IFC) owns a 15 percent stake in China Three Gorges South Asia \\n\\nInvestment Corporation (CSAIL), whose subsidiaries developed three wind farms in Pakistan. \\n\\nAnother CSAIL subsidiary is developing the Karot hydropower project. The IFC also provided \\n\\n$100 million in debt financing to support the development of Karot.215 Meanwhile, the United \\n\\nKingdom’s Oracle Power is involved in another CPEC project, the development of a surface \\n\\nmine and a 1,320 MW mine mouth power plant in the Thar Desert.216 Qatar’s Al Mirqab Capital \\n\\nis a sponsor of the Port Qasim coal-fired power plant.217 Saudi Arabia’s Al Jomaih Group is a \\n\\nsponsor of the Suki Kinari hydropower project.218\\n\\nNumerous Pakistani firms are also involved in CPEC power projects. The Hub Power Company \\n\\nLimited, for example, is invested in three CPEC power plants (Hub, TEL, and Thalnova) and \\n\\nthe Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), a Pakistan-China joint venture, which is \\n\\ndeveloping a coal mine in Thar Block II as part of CPEC.219 Habib Bank, Pakistan’s largest bank, \\n\\nhas provided equity and debt financing for the development of a coal mine by SECMC and an \\n\\nassociated power plant in Thar Block II.220\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n40 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nIt is probably safe to say that these companies would not purposely invest in unsustainable \\n\\npower plants. This is especially true for the IFC, a global development institution with a \\n\\nmission to help the private sector end extreme poverty and boost prosperity.221 The IFC is \\n\\nsupporting the Karot Hydropower Project to end Pakistan’s power shortage and improve the \\n\\nsustainability of Pakistan’s power sector.222 Similarly, shareholders of Oracle, which is listed \\n\\non the London Stock Exchange, and the Hub Power Company Limited, which is listed on \\n\\nthe Pakistan Stock Exchange, probably expect their companies to make investments that \\n\\ngenerate positive returns.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 41\\n\\n \\n\\n“Debt Trap Diplomacy”: Who is Trapping Who?\\n\\nMuch of the commentary on the debt traps of China’s Belt and Road Initiative focuses \\n\\non the risks to host countries that borrow money from Chinese financial institutions to \\n\\nfinance the development of infrastructure projects. Analysts have warned that if these \\n\\nprojects prove to be economically unviable, the borrowing country may be forced to \\n\\nsell strategic assets to Chinese buyers to repay their debts or find themselves subject to \\n\\nChinese influence.\\n\\nHowever, Yasheng Huang of MIT argues that China may also find itself “trapped” by \\n\\nunsustainable infrastructure projects financed by Chinese banks. He notes that China \\n\\nmay fall victim to the “obsolescent bargaining model,” which holds that a foreign \\n\\ninvestor loses bargaining power as its invests more in a host country.223 \\n\\nPakistan may serve as a cautionary tale of the risks Chinese firms face as they deepen \\n\\ntheir involvement in BRI countries with challenging economic environments. Islamabad’s \\n\\nfailure to make good on its promise to insulate Chinese power companies from circular \\n\\ndebt is a case in point. Pakistani government o�cials agreed to set up a revolving fun to \\n\\nensure uninterrupted payments to CPEC power plants for electricity.224 Chinese power \\n\\ncompanies and government o�cials regarded the fund as a key measure for mitigating \\n\\nthe risk of producing power in Pakistan.225 However, the fund has yet to be established. \\n\\nIn December 2018, o�cials with Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) \\n\\nsaid the agency had no money to establish the fund while the Ministry of Finance also \\n\\nrefused to contribute to the fund.226 \\n\\nAs a result, the Chinese companies that operate the Sahiwal and Port Qasim coal power \\n\\nplants are exposed to circular debt. In April 2018, Pakistani press reported that the \\n\\nSahiwal plant, the first generating unit of which came online in May 2017, had “neared \\n\\nthe brink of closure” because the government had yet to pay it US$ 172 million for \\n\\npower purchases.227 In May 2019, roughly one year after the Port Qasim coal power plant \\n\\nstarted commercial operations on April 25, 2018, the CPPA owed the Chinese-Qatari joint \\n\\nventure that operates the plant, Port Qasim Electric Power Company (PQEPC), more \\n\\nthan $150 million in late payments for electricity.228 The company’s CEO, Shen Yuming, \\n\\ntold the Pakistani media in May 2019 that the delayed payments were a daily problem \\n\\nfor the company: “We are trying our best to generate more power and get more tari� \\n\\npayment timely as you know this is a power plant, we have to import coal from the \\n\\ninternational market, also we have to repay debt to the financing banks.”229 \\n\\nAlthough the government of Pakistan issued a sovereign guarantee to support the \\n\\nCPPA’s payment obligations to PQEPC, history shows that getting the government of \\n\\nPakistan to honor its obligations under the sovereign guarantee may be easier said than \\n\\ndone. Power producers in Pakistan have invoked sovereign guarantees to collect recover \\n\\nunpaid bills at least four times in the 2010s, with Islamabad defaulting in 2012.230 \\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n42 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nThe dominance of coal in the CPEC power generation mix reflects not only a “push” from \\n\\nChina but also a strong “pull” from Pakistan. Nawaz Sharif’s election as prime minister on a \\n\\nplatform to end energy electricity shortages in the same year that Xi Jinping unveiled the \\n\\nBRI laid the groundwork for China’s emergence as a major financier of coal power plants in \\n\\nPakistan. Sharif’s objective of ending Pakistan’s electricity crisis before he stood for reelection \\n\\nin 2018 and to prioritize the use of domestic coal in a bid to decrease generation costs and \\n\\nconserve foreign exchange dovetailed with China’s search for overseas markets in which to \\n\\nexport excess coal power generation equipment and the ability of Chinese power companies \\n\\nand financial institutions to quickly execute projects.\\n\\nThe large amount of coal-fired generation capacity being developed under CPEC underscores \\n\\nthe importance of host country preferences in determining the environmental sustainability \\n\\nof the BRI. Many analyses of China’s export of coal power plants tend to focus more on \\n\\nthe factors driving China to sell coal power generation technology and equipment than on \\n\\nthe factors pushing host countries to buy them.231 In the case of Pakistan, Chinese o�cials \\n\\nand executives had an eager customer; Pakistan had been waiting for decades for foreign \\n\\ninvestors to provide the capital and know-how to develop the vast coal resources in the Thar \\n\\nDesert as a fuel for power generation. Consequently, it is not just China but also host countries \\n\\nthat will determine how green the BRI will be.\\n\\nThat said, China is certainly in a position to do more to influence the decisions other countries \\n\\nmake about what kinds of generation projects to build. While China can’t force other countries \\n\\nto buy power generation equipment they do not want, China does have the experience and the \\n\\nmoney to encourage host countries to move toward cleaner power generation mixes. China has \\n\\ndone a remarkable job of expanding the role of renewables—and shrinking the role of coal—in \\n\\nits own electricity mix. As a result, Chinese firms have considerable expertise in installing and \\n\\ncommencing operation of wind and solar plants that could be shared with Pakistan and other \\n\\ncountries less familiar with renewable energy. An issue to watch is whether Beijing will become \\n\\nmore comfortable in shaping the environmental preferences of other countries to conform with \\n\\nits emphasis on green development as an important component of the BRI.\\n\\nIt seems unlikely that China’s financing for the CPEC power projects is part of a deliberate \\n\\nstrategy to create debt problems in Pakistan in order to gain control of strategic assets or \\n\\ninfluence over decision-making in Islamabad. Indeed, the economic and strategic interests \\n\\nof the Chinese government are arguably better served by the development of sustainable \\n\\ninfrastructure projects that support the growth of Pakistan’s economy. That said, there are risks \\n\\nthat the CPEC power projects may add to Islamabad’s debt burden because of the sovereign \\n\\nguarantees issued by the government of Pakistan to support the projects and the ongoing \\n\\nbuildup of circular debt in the country’s power sector.\\n\\nThe CPEC power plants also demonstrate that it is not just host countries but also Chinese \\n\\ncompanies that may su�er adverse consequences from financing economically unviable \\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\nENERGYPOLICY.COLUMBIA.EDU | OCTOBER 2019    | 43\\n\\ninfrastructure projects. It appears that one of the main reasons Chinese firms were willing to \\n\\ndo what many other foreign investors were not—develop a large number of power plants in \\n\\nPakistan—is because the government of Pakistan committed to establishing a revolving fund to \\n\\nensure uninterrupted payments to Chinese power producers. The fund has not been established, \\n\\nprobably due to Pakistan’s precarious financial situation, and Chinese power producers are not \\n\\nbeing paid on time, making it di�cult for them to purchase coal and repay debt.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY\\n\\n44 |    CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA\\n\\nPort Qasim Coal Power Project\\n\\nNational Electric Power Regulatory Authority, Generation License for Port Qasim \\n\\nPower Company (Pvt.)

            "----------------\n",
            "China is helping Pakistan expand its coal-fired generation capacity through the financing and construction of coal power plants as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Nearly 75 percent of the generation capacity of CPEC power plants is coal-fired.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) expects that CPEC coal power plants will be largely responsible for the projected increase in the country’s coal-fired generation capacity from 3 percent as of June 30, 2017 (fewer than six months after the first CPEC coal plant began commercial operation), to 20 percent in 2025.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Concerns about environmental sustainability center on the ways in which an expansion of the amount of electricity generated globally by fossil fuels, especially coal, will increase greenhouse gas emissions, making it more di�cult if not impossible to meet the emissions targets in the Paris Agreement.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "● First, the heavy focus on coal in the new generation capacity added by the CPEC power projects stems from both “pull” factors from Pakistan and “push” factors from China:\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "− The CPEC coal power projects reflect Pakistan’s long-standing goal of diversifying its generation mix away from fuel oil toward domestic coal in an attempt to decrease generation costs and conserve foreign exchange.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "They also reflect the perception of the administration of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, whose pledge to end power outages helped his party win the 2013 election, that coal was the best option to bring on a large amount of new capacity in the short term.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Meanwhile, Chinese companies had several reasons to sell coal power plants to Pakistan, including exporting rather than warehousing excess power generation equipment, financial incentives provided by Beijing and Islamabad, and the ability to execute projects fast enough to help Sharif eradicate the blackouts hurting Pakistan’s economy before he stood for reelection in 2018.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 8 | CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA ● Second, there is a mismatch between the dominance of coal in the CPEC power generation mix and Beijing’s recent emphasis on green development as an important feature of the BRI.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "This gap between Beijing’s rhetoric and the reality on the ground can be explained in large part by Pakistan’s preference for building coal-fired generation capacity.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Moreover, China regards some of the CPEC coal power plants as environmentally friendly because they use relatively modern technologies and are expected to emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the fuel oil plants Pakistan is replacing.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Three-quarters of the new generation capacity to be added by the CPEC power sector projects is from coal-fired power plants.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "If all these plants are constructed, they will be a major driver in Pakistan’s increasing reliance on coal for electricity.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Indeed, the government of Pakistan expects the CPEC power plants to contribute to an expansion of coal’s share in Pakistan’s power generation mix from 3 percent on June 30, 2017, to 20 percent on June 30, 2025.11 This push to produce more electricity from coal stands in contrast to the move away from coal for power generation in other countries in recent years.12 INTRODUCTION THE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 10 | CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA An investigation into the projects being developed by Chinese firms in Pakistan’s power sector in the more than four years since the launch of CPEC provides an opportunity to draw some initial conclusions about two issues that lie at the heart of criticisms of the BRI—environmental sustainability and debt sustainability.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "On the former, there are concerns that BRI infrastructure, especially coal power plants, will negatively impact the environment in a variety of ways, including by harming the global climate and polluting air and water.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "On the latter, there are concerns that BRI infrastructure projects may result in problematic increases in debt, with some critics worried that China is intentionally seeking to push borrowing countries into debt distress to gain strategic leverage over them.13 PUNJAB SINDH GILGIT- BALTISTANKHYBER PAKHTUNKHWA BALOCHISTAN Port Qasim coal power plant\n",

            "----------------\n",
            "The risks associated with these infrastructure projects include increased air and water pollution, habitat loss and fragmentation, deforestation, greater wildlife mortality, the threat of invasive species; and increased greenhouse gas emissions that undermine global action to combat climate change.138 Ma Jun and Simon Zadek of Tsinghua University have warned that BRI countries could account for more than 50 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 in the worst-case scenario.139 Coal power plants often feature prominently in discussions of the environmental sustainability of the BRI because they account for a large share of the power generation projects being developed and financed by Chinese entities in BRI countries.\n",

            "----------------\n",
            "According to its calculations in 2018, coal accounts for 52 percent (or 80 GW) of the 153 GW capacity in its BRI power project pipeline.141 The CPEC coal power plants pose several threats to Pakistan’s environment.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "First, they will increase substantially Pakistan’s greenhouse gas emissions, which is likely to complicate Pakistan’s pledge, made at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris in December 2015, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.142 Second, new coal power plants risk exacerbating Pakistan’s water scarcity because mining coal and burning it for power generation are water-intensive activities.143 Third, CPEC coal power plants may create health problems from increased emissions of air pollutants and the handling and disposal of coal ash, which contains carcinogens.144 The production of Thar coal for power generation also threatens the local environment.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "The Thar Desert contains lignite coal, which has a lower heating value than bituminous coal.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "This means that more coal must be burned to produce a given amount of power, which means more pollutants, including greenhouse gases, are generated.145 Some residents of Thar have worried that the projects will contaminate and deplete their water supplies, destroy the local ecology, and result in a loss of trees and grazing lands.146 Consequently, most CPEC power projects are out of line with Beijing’s pledge to build a green BRI.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Second, some of the Chinese firms developing coal power plants abroad maintain they are clean, especially if they produce less emissions than the alternatives.\n",

            "The country had been courting foreign investors, including Chinese firms, to invest in the development of the Thar coal fields long before Beijing and Islamabad decided to launch CPEC.152 Given that Chinese firms can build other types of power plants and that Beijing is promoting the export of wind turbines and solar panels along with thermal and hydropower generation equipment, it is plausible that if Pakistan had prioritized the development of renewable energy projects, the composition of the generation mix of the CPEC power plants would be di�erent.153 The dominance of coal in the generation mix of the CPEC power plants may also reflect a reluctance on the part of the Chinese government to dictate the environmental policies of other countries even though China certainly has the financial resources and expertise in building solar, wind, and hydropower projects to help countries to shift their generation mixes in a greener direction.\n",

            "----------------\n",
            "For example, one executive told the Pakistani media that the company had adopted the highest international standards and most modern technology to ensure the production of clean energy at the Port Qasim plant.159 Similarly, an article on PowerChina’s website states that the Sahiwal power plant “has the highest operation e�ciency, most advanced technologies and is the most environmentally-friendly of any coal-fired plant in the country.\n",
            "----------------\n",

            "----------------\n",
            "Third, the supercritical coal plants being developed as part of CPEC should emit fewer greenhouse gasses than the fuel oil plants that Pakistan is seeking to replace with the coal- fired ones.\n",

            "Indeed, the Asian Development Bank, which is financing the construction of a 600 MW supercritical coal-fired unit at the Jamshoro Thermal Power Station, stated that supercritical coal plants emit fewer greenhouse gases than Pakistan’s existing heavy-fuel-oil- fired plants.165 According to the Asian Development Bank, the new supercritical coal-fired unit at Jamshoro will emit 750 grams of carbon dioxide per kilowatt hour compared to the 930 grams of carbon dioxide emitted by the existing heavy fuel oil unit at Jamshoro.166 However, other CPEC coal power plants are less environmentally friendly, especially from a climate perspective.167 Three of the Thar coal plants and the Gwadar coal power plant use—or will use—subcritical technology (see table 5).\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "The Gwadar coal power plant should be as clean from a traditional pollutant perspective as a supercritical plant if all the planned pollution abatement equipment, including FGD, ESP, and SCR, is installed and run well.168 Table 5: Generation technologies of CPEC coal power plants Sources: See Appendix A.\n",

            "----------------\n",
            "CPPA buys the electricity from the generation companies and sells it to the distribution companies, which sell it to consumers.22 However, the distribution companies are often unable to pay CPPA in full due to factors including the failure of the government to compensate them in a timely manner for below-market tari�s, customers being unwilling or unable to pay their bills in full, theft, technical losses, and distribution losses.\n",

            "Islamabad’s quest to substantially increase the use of coal in power generation dovetailed with Beijing’s ambitions to find new markets for Chinese manufacturers of coal power equipment as China greens its electricity mix and the generous financial incentives o�ered by Islamabad and Beijing to spur Chinese power companies to develop power plants in Pakistan.\n",

            "The cost of electricity generated from these oil products, which are largely imported, has been much higher than electricity generated by other fuels, especially coal.\n",

            "----------------\n",
            "There are probably several reasons for Islamabad’s decision to give renewable energy projects a minor role in CPEC and in resolving the country’s electricity crisis.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "First, there are concerns within Islamabad about the ability of the country’s overutilized transmission system to incorporate large amounts of new variable generation.58 Indeed, NEPRA noted in its State of the Industry Report 2015 that renewable energy should be inducted gradually into the system and that detailed studies “to identify short term and long term expansion plans for strengthening the grid system” need to be conducted in order to create more space for renewable energy on the grid.59 Similarly, several Pakistani energy experts argue in a paper published by the Asian Development Bank Institute in 2018 that the biggest obstacle to generating more electricity from wind and solar is the lack of adequate transmission and distribution infrastructure to absorb large amounts of power from intermittent sources of energy.60 Second, solar and wind were more expensive sources of electricity than coal when China and Pakistan launched CPEC, which made them a less attractive source of electricity than coal to Islamabad given its goal of generating more a�ordable electricity.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Today, however, wind and solar are the least expensive sources of new electricity in Pakistan.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "It also noted that the returns on investment earned by Chinese companies are very low.70 Chinese power companies have also identified numerous risks to investing in Pakistan, notably the risk of delayed payments for electricity, which makes it di�cult for companies operating power plants to purchase coal and repay lenders.71 High Returns on Equity Islamabad increased the guaranteed return on equity (ROE) for coal-fired power plants to entice foreign investors, especially from China, to invest in Pakistan’s power sector.72 In June 2013 NEPRA fixed the ROE for power projects based on local coal at 17 percent per year and the ROE for power projects based on imported coal at 20 percent per year.73 NEPRA sets the ROE for power projects because the ROE is one of several factors that determines the cost of electricity.74 However, the failure of these rates to secure new investments prompted the now- defunct Ministry of Water and Power to ask NEPRA in February 2014 to reconsider the tari�s, THE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 22 | CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA and thus the ROEs, for coal power plants.75 In June 2014 NEPRA increased the ROE for coal power plants to 26.5–29.5 percent for local coal and to 24.5–27.2 percent for imported coal.76 The following month, NEPRA set even higher ROEs of 30.65–34.49 percent for mine mouth power plants based on Thar coal (see table 4).77\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "For example, PowerChina, one of the owners of the Port Qasim Electric Power Corporation, identified the sovereign guarantee as a factor that will mitigate the risk of delayed electricity payments in a filing with the Shanghai Stock Exchange.84 Similarly, Oracle Power PLC, a London-listed coal developer seeking to develop an integrated coal mine and power plant with Chinese firms as part of CPEC, mentions the sovereign guarantee in presentations and announcements about the project.85\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "The government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in the amount of $700 million to the consortiums of Chinese and Pakistani banks that are providing $1.5 billion to an integrated coal mine and power plant in Thar Block II being developed by project companies comprised of Chinese and Pakistani firms.86 Revolving Funds The government of Pakistan also sought to attract Chinese investment in coal power projects by pledging to establish revolving funds backed by sovereign guarantees to ensure that power plants developed as part of CPEC are paid on time for the electricity they produce.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "His remarks align with a Pakistani press report detailing that the Chinese refused to build any power plants until Islamabad agreed to protect Chinese investors and lenders from circular debt.91 THE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 24 | CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA The “Push” from China Islamabad’s e�orts to increase the role of coal in Pakistan’s electricity mix aligned with the Chinese government’s e�orts to partially alleviate excess capacity in a variety of industries, including coal power generation equipment, by encouraging Chinese companies to find new markets abroad.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Find New Markets Abroad Chinese firms are developing coal-fired power plants in Pakistan and other countries to generate new sources of demand for coal power equipment in the face of constrained opportunities to expand at home as China continues to green its electricity mix.\n",

            "The capacity of generator sets produced that were actually installed declined from 62 percent in 2008 to 50 percent in 2017 before increasing to 58 percent in 2018.93 The share of capacity of generator sets manufactured in 2013 that were actually installed in that year was less than 50 percent.94 Figure 3: China’s generator set production exceeds new generation capacity Source: National Bureau of Statistics of China and China Electricity Council THE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS:\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "The share of renewables increased from 29 percent to 60 percent over the same period (see figure 4).95 Figure 4: China’s new generation capaciity by fuel Source: China Electricity Council The weakening demand for generators is partly due to Beijing’s e�orts to combat air pollution by increasing China’s use of hydropower and other renewables.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "China’s Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2006–2010) introduced for the first time a target of 10 percent for nonfossil energy consumption.96 Beijing subsequently increased the nonfossil energy target to 11.4 percent in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), to 15 percent in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016– 2020), and to “around 20%” by 2030.97 The Chinese government is also considering requiring that renewables account for at least 35 percent of China’s electricity consumption by 2030, according to a draft plan viewed by Bloomberg in September 2018.98 Meanwhile, major cities have also shuttered coal-fired power plants to improve air quality.\n",

            "The construction of the power plant drove the export of more than RMB 7 billion ($1.1 billion) worth of equipment, making it a “model project” for the export of Chinese standards, equipment, and technology according to the China Power News Network.107 Similarly, the Hub coal power plant is expected to drive the export of $900 million of equipment, including boiler systems, fuel systems, and circulating water systems.108 Meanwhile, the State Grid Corporation of China is building it first overseas ±660 kV high- voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission line in Pakistan between Matiari and Lahore, which will evacuate electricity produced by seven CPEC coal power plants.109\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "Even though the government of Pakistan provided a sovereign guarantee for the power purchase agreement, PowerChina was concerned that Islamabad might not be able to honor its guarantee because of the Pakistani power sector’s debt.121 Consequently, Sinosure agreed to underwrite delayed payments from Pakistan; if the government of Pakistan is unable to reimburse in a timely fashion the project company jointly owned by PowerChina and Qatar’s Al Mirqab Capital for power purchases, the company can file a claim with Sinosure for breach of contract.122 The Need for Speed The large share of coal-fired capacity in CPEC power projects is also consistent with the priority former Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif placed on bringing online as much new generation capacity as fast as possible to make good on his pledge to end Pakistan’s electricity shortages before he stood for reelection in 2018.123 Chinese companies can build coal power plants very quickly, even in as short a time frame as less than a year.124 Moreover, coordination between Chinese financiers and power companies expedited the financing for CPEC power projects.\n",

            "Electricity generated by new power plants—regardless of whether they are part of CPEC—is likely to increase circular debt if the percentage of transmission and distribution losses remain constant and electricity consumption and bills increase.192\n",

            "Pakistani government o�cials agreed to set up a revolving fun to ensure uninterrupted payments to CPEC power plants for electricity.224 Chinese power companies and government o�cials regarded the fund as a key measure for mitigating the risk of producing power in Pakistan.225 However, the fund has yet to be established.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "In April 2018, Pakistani press reported that the Sahiwal plant, the first generating unit of which came online in May 2017, had “neared the brink of closure” because the government had yet to pay it US$ 172 million for power purchases.227 In May 2019, roughly one year after the Port Qasim coal power plant started commercial operations on April 25, 2018, the CPPA owed the Chinese-Qatari joint venture that operates the plant, Port Qasim Electric Power Company (PQEPC), more than $150 million in late payments for electricity.228 The company’s CEO, Shen Yuming, told the Pakistani media in May 2019 that the delayed payments were a daily problem for the company: “We are trying our best to generate more power and get more tari� payment timely as you know this is a power plant, we have to import coal from the international market, also we have to repay debt to the financing banks.\n",

            "Sharif’s objective of ending Pakistan’s electricity crisis before he stood for reelection in 2018 and to prioritize the use of domestic coal in a bid to decrease generation costs and conserve foreign exchange dovetailed with China’s search for overseas markets in which to export excess coal power generation equipment and the ability of Chinese power companies and financial institutions to quickly execute projects.\n",

            "Concerns about debt sustainability focus on whether China’s lending in support of infrastructure projects will lead to problematic increases in debt, with some analysts maintaining that Beijing is intentionally seeking to push countries into debt distress in an attempt to gain control over strategic assets or decision-making in borrowing countries.\n",
            "The main findings of this study are threefold.\n",
            "● First, the heavy focus on coal in the new generation capacity added by the CPEC power projects stems from both “pull” factors from Pakistan and “push” factors from China:\n",
            "− The CPEC coal power projects reflect Pakistan’s long-standing goal of diversifying its generation mix away from fuel oil toward domestic coal in an attempt to decrease generation costs and conserve foreign exchange.\n",
            "They also reflect the perception of the administration of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, whose pledge to end power outages helped his party win the 2013 election, that coal was the best option to bring on a large amount of new capacity in the short term.\n",
            "Although Pakistan has vast renewable energy potential, solar and wind power were considered too expensive and di�cult to integrate into electric grids.\n",
            "−\n",
            "Meanwhile, Chinese companies had several reasons to sell coal power plants to Pakistan, including exporting rather than warehousing excess power generation equipment, financial incentives provided by Beijing and Islamabad, and the ability to execute projects fast enough to help Sharif eradicate the blackouts hurting Pakistan’s economy before he stood for reelection in 2018.\n",
            "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY THE CHINA-PAKISTAN ECONOMIC CORRIDOR POWER PROJECTS: INSIGHTS INTO ENVIRONMENTAL AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY 8 | CENTER ON GLOBAL ENERGY POLICY | COLUMBIA SIPA ● Second, there is a mismatch between the dominance of coal in the CPEC power generation mix and Beijing’s recent emphasis on green development as an important feature of the BRI.\n",
            "This gap between Beijing’s rhetoric and the reality on the ground can be explained in large part by Pakistan’s preference for building coal-fired generation capacity.\n",
            "----------------\n",
            "The Chinese government has a long-standing reluctance to interfere in decisions of this type.\n",
            "Moreover, China regards some of the CPEC coal power plants as environmentally friendly because they use relatively modern technologies and are expected to emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions than the fuel oil plants Pakistan is replacing.\n",
            "● Third, there is a risk that the CPEC power projects will add to Pakistan’s sovereign debt burden, but multiple factors indicate that any increase in sovereign debt from these projects is unlikely to be the result of a deliberate strategy on the part of China.\n",
            "Although the debt financing arrangements for CPEC power sector projects primarily involve loans from Chinese banks to project companies wholly or partly owned by Chinese firms, these projects may increase Pakistan’s debt because of sovereign guarantees issued by Islamabad to support CPEC power projects and the liquidity crisis in Pakistan’s power sector known as circular debt.\n",
            "That said, several aspects of the China-Pakistan relationship and the large stake that China’s government and companies have in the success of CPEC indicate that Chinese interests are better served by sustainable CPEC projects than unsustainable ones.\n",

            "In May 2013, Chinese premier Li Keqiang proposed that China and Pakistan focus on developing “priority projects in connectivity, energy development and power generation” and an economic corridor linking the two countries.1 China and Pakistan formally launched the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) nearly two years later when President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April 2015.2 CPEC is a collection of energy and transport projects, some of which will connect western China to the Arabian Sea.3 The Chinese Embassy in Pakistan reported that as of the end of 2018, 22 CPEC projects worth US$18.9 billion had been initiated or completed.4\n",
            "Although $18.9 billion is far below the $62 billion often cited as the value of the CPEC project portfolio, it is nonetheless a considerable amount of foreign capital for Pakistan.5\n",
            "The Chinese government has regarded CPEC as the bellwether of President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which he unveiled in 2013.6 Once described by Xi as a “project of the century,” the BRI aims to forge greater global connectivity, including through the construction of infrastructure, notably in emerging economies.7 The initial importance of CPEC as the leading edge of the BRI is reflected in the oft quoted remark made by China’s foreign minister Wang Yi in 2015: “if ‘One Belt, One Road,’ is like a sweet symphony involving and benefitting every country, then the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the sweet symphony of the melody’s first movement.\n",

Although influenced by China's initiatives, it is ultimately determined by Pakistan's needs. This indicates that while coal-fired power is viewed as an unclean energy source globally, it is currently what Pakistan requires. Furthermore, in Pakistan, coal-fired power plants are expected to emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to the fuel oil plants they are replacing."
