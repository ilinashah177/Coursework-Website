This \\n\\nplatform supports building \\n\\nshared culture and arts, \\n\\nenhancing people-to-people \\n\\ncontacts through tourism and \\n\\ntrade, fostering regional \\n\\nconnectivity through initiatives \\n\\nlike the Belt and Road Initiative \\n\\n(BRI) and the Eurasian Region, and promoting research cooperation.PRCCSF calls for closer \\n\\ncoordination between research institutes in Pakistan, China, and other regional countries to pave \\n\\nthe way for joint ventures in multiple areas of mutual interest. We are dedicated to advancing the \\n\\nconcept of a community with a shared future, as championed by President Xi Jinping. Our center \\n\\nhas won the Outstanding Individual Contribution Award from CUC as the top research center \\n\\nglobally for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023. \\n\\nIn addition to our focus on enriching research on various aspects of Pakistan-China relations, \\n\\nPRCCSF is deeply involved in significant regional and global developments. Our platform for \\n\\ndialogue and exchange strives towards enhanced cooperation and synergy between the media and \\n\\nacademic communities. The primary aim of organizing this conference is to raise awareness \\n\\nabout the concept of community of shared future and how it is linked with CPEC. We should be \\n\\nsteadfast in our commitment to forging a human community, working towards a shared future for \\n\\nall of humanity. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n \\n\\nChina has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared futures with firm \\n\\nconviction and solid actions. This includes promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, \\n\\nimplementing the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global \\n\\nCivilization Initiative, and proposing a range of regional and bilateral initiatives aimed at \\n\\nbuilding communities with shared futures. More countries and people are coming to understand \\n\\nthat this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, \\n\\njustice, and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better \\n\\nworld.Together, we can achieve remarkable milestones in our shared journey towards enhancing \\n\\nour community with a shared future for mankind.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Professor Li Huailiang, Dean of the Institute for a Community with Shared \\n\\nFuture, Communication University of China (CUC), Beijing, China \\n\\nDear guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to join you in this important UH \\n\\nconference to discuss the CPEC and the building of a global community of shared futures as an \\n\\nimportant pilot project of the Belt and \\n\\nRoad Initiative (BRI). The CPEC has \\n\\nmade remarkable achievements since \\n\\nits launch. It has not only promoted the \\n\\neconomic development of China and \\n\\nPakistan but also made positive \\n\\ncontributions to regional peace, \\n\\nstability, and prosperity. Through the \\n\\nCPEC, we see great potential for \\n\\ninfrastructure connectivity. The \\n\\nconstruction of roads, ports, and energy projects has created more favourable conditions for trade \\n\\nand investment, promoted industrial upgrading and transformation, and brought tangible benefits \\n\\nto the two peoples. However, the CPEC is much more than that; it is a vivid practice of building \\n\\na global community of shared futures. In the era of globalisation, countries face many common \\n\\nchallenges, such as climate change, public health security, and even economic development. To \\n\\nbuild a global community of shared futures, we must transcend national boundaries and work \\n\\ntogether to meet this challenge. The successful experience of the CPEC tells us that common \\n\\ndevelopment can only be achieved through openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit. \\n\\nWe need to strengthen policy communication. promote trade and investment liberalization. \\n\\npromote the free flow of capital, technology, and talent and create a more fair, transparent, and \\n\\npredictable business environment in order to practice the concept of building a global community \\n\\nof shared futures. The Communication University of China (CUC) established the Institute of \\n\\nGlobal Community of Shared Future in 2019. The academy is a strategic research platform and a \\n\\nunit directly under the university; its mission is to conduct theoretical research and international \\n\\nspread of the concept of the global community of shared future. Since its establishment, the \\n\\nInstitute has achieved fruitful research results. As the concept of a global community of shared \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n14 \\n \\n\\nfutures has been widely recognised in the international community, we have found many friends \\n\\nin the international academic community and established 20 international research centres in \\n\\nAsia, Europe, Africa, America, and Latin America. The Pakistan Research Centre of the Global \\n\\nCommunity of Shared Futures is one of the best of these 20 research centres. \\n\\nUnder the leadership of Mr. Khalid Pakistan Research Centre for a Community with Shared \\n\\nFutures (PRCCSF) has made outstanding contributions to the dissemination of the concept of the \\n\\nglobal community of shared futures in Pakistan and around the world. Pakistan Research Centre \\n\\nfor a Community with Shared Futures (PRCCSF) has been the top-ranking centre for the last \\n\\nthree years. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Khalid. \\n\\nAcademic exchange is an important part of people-to-people and cultural exchange, which can \\n\\nenhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. We hope that through \\n\\nmore cooperation in academic, cultural, and educational fields, we can narrow the distance \\n\\nbetween the two countries and lay a solid public opinion foundation for the long-term \\n\\ndevelopment of China-Pakistan relations. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The CPEC has not only promoted the economic development of China and Pakistan but also \\n\\nmade positive contributions to regional peace, stability, and prosperity. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The successful experience of the CPEC tells us that common development can only be \\n\\nachieved through openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is need to strengthen policy communication. promote trade and investment \\n\\nliberalization. promote the free flow of capital, technology, and talent and create a more fair, \\n\\ntransparent, and predictable business environment in order to practice the concept of building \\n\\na global community of shared futures. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Muhammad Asim Khan, Head of Development Communication, Ministry of \\n\\nPlanning, Development and Special Initiatives, Government of Pakistan \\n\\nTopic:  “Introduction to Conference objectives and key Highlights \\n\\nIt\\'s really an honour and privilege to address you today. Our gathering today reflects our shared \\n\\nvision and commitment to exploring the \\n\\nimmense potential of the China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nand its role in fostering a brighter future \\n\\nfor our communities and beyond. I\\'m \\n\\nparticularly honoured to have a long \\n\\nassociation with the China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC). Since its \\n\\ninception, I have had the privilege of \\n\\nwitnessing the signing of its framework agreement in 2015 and serving as its \\n\\nfirst spokesperson for the Belt and Road initiative launched by the honourable president Xi \\n\\nJinping. This conference aims to achieve the following objectives: highlight the strategic \\n\\nsignificance of CPEC, discuss historical context strategic goals, and transform the impact of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on regional and global skills. Second, review key \\n\\nachievements and milestones to reflect on the progress made during phase one and to analyse the \\n\\nsignificant infrastructural and energy projects that have been commissioned. Third, discuss \\n\\ncurrent and future energy projects to explore the ongoing and future energy projects that are vital \\n\\nfor sustainable economic growth and development. The fourth objective is to promote \\n\\ncooperation and collaboration to foster a dialogue on industrial relocation, transport \\n\\ninfrastructure, environmental challenges, and The fifth goal is to enhance socioeconomic \\n\\ndevelopment and connectivity. Our conference is structured into three key sessions, each \\n\\naddressing critical aspects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In session one, we \\n\\nwill be discussing the strategic significance and infrastructure development of the China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This session will provide a comprehensive overview of the \\n\\nhistorical background, strategic goals, and key milestones achieved in Phase 1, and it will also \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n16 \\n \\n\\ncover the significant energy project that have been installed and their impact on the region and \\n\\nthe well-being of the people of Pakistan. In the second session, we will be discussing cooperation \\n\\nunder the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and we will have a \\n\\nspecial focus on the cooperative framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). \\n\\nThe topics of discussion will include industrial relocation progress on transport infrastructure \\n\\nprojects, environmental challenges and opportunities, and challenges associated with special \\n\\neconomic zones. In the third session, we will be discussing socio-economic development and \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) phase two for regional connectivity. Our final \\n\\nsession will explore socioeconomic development and regional connectivity under China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) Phase 2, and the key topics will include new corridor proposals for \\n\\nagricultural cooperation, cultural exchange, and socioeconomic challenges and opportunities for \\n\\nregional integration. \\n\\nWe expect a few key takeaways for all of the participants, like an in-depth understanding of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework and the achievements till now, as well as \\n\\nnetworking opportunities like engaging with experts, policymakers, and stakeholders to foster \\n\\ncollaboration and build partnerships. Thirdly, insights into the best practices learned from case \\n\\nstudies and discussions on \\n\\nsuccessful projects and \\n\\ninitiatives. Under the China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor \\n\\n(CPEC), similarly, we will \\n\\nlearn about how policy \\n\\nrecommendations contribute to \\n\\nthe development of actionable \\n\\npolicy recommendations for \\n\\nsuccessful implementation of \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects. Last but not least, we expect innovative \\n\\nsolutions, like exploring innovative solutions to address the challenges and leverage \\n\\nopportunities presented by the CPEC. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We will learn about how policy recommendations contribute to the development of \\n\\nactionable policy recommendations for successful implementation of China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) projects. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We expect innovative solutions, like exploring innovative solutions to address the challenges \\n\\nand leverage opportunities presented by the CPEC. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Guest of Honor His Excellency Ambassador Jiang Zaidong, Embassy of the \\n\\nPeople\\'s Republic of China to Pakistan \\n\\nMinister Ahsan Iqbal, to the host of the conference, and to all the distinguished guests, \\n\\nforsupporting China-Pakistan \\n\\nfriendship and also your commitment \\n\\nto the great cause of building a \\n\\ncommunity with a shared future for \\n\\nmankind. Today, my speech will \\n\\nfocus on three main aspects: how \\n\\ndoes China handle state-to-state \\n\\nrelations based on the Five Principles \\n\\nof Peaceful Coexistence, how does \\n\\nChina build the world through the \\n\\nVision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, and how does China \\n\\npractice this through high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the CPEC construction. \\n\\nFirst, as the Chinese saying goes, be kind to your neighbor, and promote harmony among all \\n\\nnations.The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have provided a historical answer to the \\n\\nvery important question of how to properly handle state-to-state relations. On 28th June , the \\n\\nConference Marking the 70th Anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was \\n\\nheld in Beijing. President Xi Jinping attended the conference and delivered an important speech. \\n\\nPresident Xi expounded on the essence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and their \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n18 \\n \\n\\nrelevance for our times, which was highly endorsed by all parties present. Seventy years ago, \\n\\nagainst the backdrop of national independence and liberation movements swept across the globe \\n\\nin the wake of the Second World War, and the scourge of hot wars and the confrontation of the \\n\\nCold War, Chinese leaders put forth in full the following Five Principles, i.e. mutual respect for \\n\\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each \\n\\nother’s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Five \\n\\nPrinciples have been included in a series of important international documentsover the past 70 \\n\\nyears, and have been widely recognized and observed by the international community. They \\n\\nhave become open, inclusive, and universally applicable basic norms for international relations \\n\\nand fundamental principles of international law.  \\n\\nThey have set a historic benchmark for international relations and international rule of law, \\n\\nserved as the prime guidance for the establishment and development of relations between \\n\\ncountries with different social systems. They have been a powerful rallying force behind the \\n\\nefforts of developing countries to pursue cooperation and self-strength through unity, and \\n\\ncontributed historic wisdom to the reform and improvement of the international order. The past \\n\\n70 years’extraordinary journey proved that, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are a \\n\\ncommon asset of the international community to be valued, inherited and further promoted. \\n\\nSecond, a just cause should be pursued for common good. Building a Community with a Shared \\n\\nFuture for Mankind answered the call of the times of ―what kind of world to build and how to \\n\\nbuild it‖. Our world today is going through accelerated transformation unseen in a century, and \\n\\ninternational situation is going through turbulence and transformation. The Ukraine crisis and the \\n\\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict have been been dragging on. President Xi Jinping put forward the \\n\\nvision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind. This vision captures the \\n\\nreality that all countries have a shared future and intertwined interests, and sets a new model of \\n\\nequality and coexistence for international relations. It responds to the world’s prevailing trend of \\n\\npeace, development, cooperation and win-win, and opens up new prospects for peace and \\n\\nprogress. It also keeps pace with the historic trend toward multipolarity and economic \\n\\nglobalization, and inspires new ways to achieve development and security.Precisely because this \\n\\nvision aligns with the shared aspirations of all nations, and charts the course for the development \\n\\nof world civilization, it has been widely welcomed by people around the world, and has become \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n19 \\n \\n\\na flag spearheading the trend of the times. This vision carries forward the same spirit of the Five \\n\\nPrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence, and is the most effective move to sustain, promote and \\n\\nupgrade the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the new circumstances. It has and will \\n\\ncontinue to move the world to a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress. \\n\\nSince BRI was proposed, China has adhered to the principle of ―planning together, building \\n\\ntogether, and benefiting together‖, and has continuously advanced in the direction of high-quality \\n\\ndevelopment. From laying the foundation, building the structure to taking the roots, we have \\n\\ncontinuously devoted to enhancing policy, infrastructure, trade, financial and people-to-people \\n\\nconnectivity, and building a cooperation platform of extensive participation and international \\n\\nconsensus.  \\n\\nNot long ago, when met with Prime Minister Shahbaz who was paying an official visit to China, \\n\\nPresident Xi Jinping pointed out that China is ready to synergize the high-quality Belt and Road \\n\\ncooperation with Pakistan’s development plans, carry out cooperation in agriculture, mining, \\n\\nsocial livelihood and other areas in accordance with local conditions, and jointly develop \\n\\nfivecorridors featuring growth, livelihood-enhancing, innovation, green development and \\n\\nopenness, with focus on building an upgraded version of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor \\n\\n(CPEC), so as to promote deeper and more substantive progress in the high-quality cooperation \\n\\non CPEC and help boost Pakistan’s economic and social development. Under the strategic \\n\\nguidance of the leaders of the two countries, we are ready to work with Pakistan to accelerate the \\n\\nbuilding of an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era and \\n\\nlead the great process of building a community with a shared future for mankind. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The vision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind captures the reality \\n\\nthat all countries have a shared future and intertwined interests, and sets a new model of \\n\\nequality and coexistence for international relations. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China is ready to synergize the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with Pakistan’s \\n\\ndevelopment plans, carry out cooperation in agriculture, mining, social livelihood and other \\n\\nareas \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n20 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China has adhered to the principle of ―planning together, building together, and benefiting \\n\\ntogether‖, and has continuously advanced in the direction of high-quality development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We are ready to work with Pakistan to accelerate the building of an even closer China-\\n\\nPakistan community with a shared future in the new era and lead the great process of \\n\\nbuilding a community with a shared future for mankind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n21 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Hina Shahid, Head of Department of Media Studies,  \\n\\nFoundation University, Islamabad \\n\\nTopic: “BRI as an Instrument of Global Civilization Initiative” \\n\\n \\n\\nBRI, upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. We \\n\\nall witnessed that BRI follows \\n\\na Silk Road spirit featuring \\n\\npeace and cooperation, \\n\\nopenness and inclusiveness, \\n\\nmutual learning and mutual \\n\\nbenefit. It focuses on policy \\n\\ncoordination, connectivity of \\n\\ninfrastructure, unimpeded \\n\\ntrade, financial integration, \\n\\nand closer people-to-people \\n\\nties. It has turned ideas into actions and vision into reality, and the initiative itself into a public \\n\\nproduct widely welcomed by the international community. From high-level plans to intensive \\n\\nand meticulous implementation, BRI has advanced in solid steps as the world has witnessed \\n\\nhigh-quality development that bring benefits to local people, and build a global community of \\n\\nshared future. \\n\\nIf we look at the progress of last ten years, starting from the Policy coordination that is an \\n\\nimportant guarantee for this initiative, and an essential precondition for joint actions. The Belt \\n\\nand Road Initiative has been incorporated into important documents of international \\n\\norganizations including the UN Security Council Resolution 2344, calling on the international \\n\\ncommunity to strengthen regional economic cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative and \\n\\nother development initiatives, while for the first time enshrining the concept of \"a community of \\n\\nshared future for mankind\"  more and more countries and international organizations have signed \\n\\nintergovernmental cooperation agreements on the Belt and Road Initiative thus ensuring \\n\\ncoordination and cooperation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n22 \\n \\n\\nHowever, a growing deficit in peace, development, security and governance, together with \\n\\ninterwinding conventional and non-conventional security issues such as regional conflicts, arms \\n\\nraces, food security, terrorism, cyber-attacks, climate change, energy crises, major infectious \\n\\ndiseases, and artificial intelligence problems, poses a grave threat to the beautiful planet on \\n\\nwhich all humans live.In the face of emerging global difficulties and challenges, human society \\n\\nneeds new ideas, new concepts, and a more just, equitable, balanced, resilient and effective \\n\\nglobal governance system.  China, as a responsible state, comes forward once again to introduce \\n\\nGlobal Civilization Initiative. Cultural connectivity, as championed by the GCI, encourages \\n\\ninclusive coexistence and deters aggression by promoting mutual respect and understanding. GCI \\n\\nhas inspired a new era of unity, understanding, and peaceful coexistence on a global scale. This \\n\\nvision aligns with the ethos of the BRI, which has, since its inception, aimed to revive and extend \\n\\nthe ancient Silk Road\\'s spirit of exchange and cooperation.  \\n\\nThe GCI, alongside the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, has \\n\\ngarnered international support as a significant public good provided by China to the world. These \\n\\nglobal initiatives reflect China\\'s vision and foreign policy toward achieving development, \\n\\nprosperity, security, and stability worldwide, defining the path China has set to deal with \\n\\nothers.GCI aligns with the Belt and Road Initiative\\'s goals of extending ancient exchanges along \\n\\nthe Silk Road into a modern framework. The ancient Silk Road served as a central hub for the \\n\\nexchange of civilizations, promoting trade, sharing cultures, and enhancing mutual \\n\\nunderstanding. The Belt and Road Initiative carries forward the rich legacy of the ancient Silk \\n\\nRoad, aiming to foster collaboration and cooperation among civilizations. \\n\\nThe GCI’s mission is transformational, aiming to reshape global connections by encouraging \\n\\nstates to collaborate in an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. This effort rejects the \\n\\nconventional concept of a \"clash of civilizations\" in favor of civilizations enhancing each other \\n\\nvia communication and trade. The GCI is founded on principles such as mutual respect, open \\n\\nconversation, and cooperative growth, all of which seek to build a sense of shared global \\n\\nprogress. \\n\\nCultural exchanges play a unique and irreplaceable role in the rejuvenation of China and the \\n\\nbuilding of a global community with a shared future. Chinese wisdom, passed down through \\n\\nmillennia, advocates for the mutual prosperity of global civilizations, welcomes the flourishing \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n \\n\\nof popular cultural products, and encourages the youth to inherit and reinvent their proud \\n\\ntraditions.  \\n\\nFor instance, cultural exchanges between Pakistan and China have significantly strengthened \\n\\npeople-to-people contacts \\n\\nbetween the two countries. \\n\\nThe cultural performances and \\n\\nartistic collaborations between \\n\\nthem have provided a better \\n\\nunderstanding of each other\\'s \\n\\npeople and culture, fostering a \\n\\nsense of camaraderie and \\n\\nmutual respect.Let us embrace \\n\\nthis vision and work \\n\\ncollectively towards a world \\n\\nof unity, understanding, and peace.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Belt and Road Initiative has significantly strengthened people-to-people ties, artistic \\n\\ncollaborations, and cultural understanding, celebrating the richness of humanity\\'s cultural \\n\\ntapestry and nurturing a sense of interconnectedness and common purpose. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Cultural exchanges between Pakistan and China have significantly strengthened people-to-\\n\\npeople contacts between the two countries. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Chinese wisdom, passed down through millennia, advocates for the mutual prosperity of \\n\\nglobal civilizations, welcomes the flourishing of popular cultural products, and encourages \\n\\nthe youth to inherit and reinvent their proud traditions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Mr. Zafar ul Hassan, Joint Chief Economist, Planning Ministry \\n\\nTopic: “Key Milestones and Achievements in Phase I of CPEC under BRI” \\n\\nIn the first phase, the major focus was on building infrastructure gaps, bridging the gap in the \\n\\nenergy sector, and improving highways.  In the \\n\\nsecond phase, which is more critical to bring \\n\\ninfrastructure utilising this infrastructure energy \\n\\nand translate into economic growth, SEZs are \\n\\ncritical. So far, four SEZs are almost developed, \\n\\nso this development phase is going on, so we \\n\\nhave to populate into industry. Why is it critical \\n\\nfor Pakistan to just cooperate or bring \\n\\ninternational cooperation? Pakistan is \\n\\nconsistently facing a balance of payments \\n\\nproblem, and because of this problem, after 2–3 years, the economic stabilisation is being \\n\\nundertaken with the help of the IMF, which forces us to take critical decisions regarding the cost \\n\\nof energy taxation. This is also affecting the investment climate, and this is making it difficult to \\n\\nbring industries into the SEZs once the economy stabilises. Then it will be easier for the country \\n\\nto operate the industrial zone, and it will also bring the economy back on track. The bringing of \\n\\nChinese experts in different areas has recently been undertaken, and the first page of experts to \\n\\nanalyse the Pakistani structural transformation is on the way. And we will give a sectoral strategy \\n\\nfor which sector will be incorporated, and the one area that we have ignored and where a lot of \\n\\nwork is going on is the agriculture sector. \\n\\nThe cooperation in the field of livestock and agriculture is leading to the rural problem, so we \\n\\nhave to focus in the second phase on, uh, just creating jobs, and the second element, which we \\n\\nhave ignored, was undertaken during the first phase of the socioeconomic development of the \\n\\ncountry. \\n\\nDevelopment. I think it has been ignored, but I think it is not very public, but a lot of things are \\n\\nhappening, like 15,000 solar panels given to people who are not part of the national grade.These \\n\\nwere just transforming lives in this area where electricity has become almost human rights. Many \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n \\n\\npeople do not have access, so under the social economic umbrella, 15,000 people were given \\n\\nsolar, and now their houses are lightened by the unit. And agriculture equipment is given to \\n\\nvarious universities that are doing research, and they\\'re upgrading their skills. \\n\\nDuring COVID 19, China has given under the social economic umbrella 8 billion R&B, which is \\n\\nutilised for various projects and is now also used for upgrading social economic development, so \\n\\nthese are areas that are transforming lives and livelihoods. These areas need to be focused on \\n\\nmore, and these areas are more \\n\\nrelated to the subject matter of this \\n\\nseminar. CPEC is working slowly \\n\\nunder constraints; it may be a \\n\\nbalance of payment constraint or a \\n\\nlower economic growth constraint, \\n\\nbut surely the system is working. \\n\\nSecond phase we will be thinking \\n\\nmore about the people\\'s decisions \\n\\nbecause in the first phase, \\n\\ninfrastructure was focused so people\\'s lives were not impacted, but in the second field, although \\n\\nthe transactions might not be on that level, they will transform much faster than in the first phase, \\n\\nand this is critical for the people at that time as well \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 First phase of CPEC focused on addressing infrastructure and energy gaps in Pakistan, which \\n\\nwere essential for laying the foundation for economic growth.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 International cooperation, particularly through CPEC, is seen as crucial in stabilizing the \\n\\neconomy and attracting industries to SEZs, which are key to long-term growth. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The second phase of CPEC emphasizes utilizing existing infrastructure to boost economic \\n\\ngrowth. This includes a stronger focus on agriculture and livestock, areas previously \\n\\noverlooked, to create jobs and address rural challenges.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Initiatives like providing solar panels to 15,000 households and upgrading agricultural \\n\\nresearch have improved lives in rural areas.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n26 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Muzammil Zia, Regional Connectivity & Infrastructure Specialist,  \\n\\nCPEC Secretariat \\n\\nTopic: “Overview of Commissioned Infrastructure Projects of CPEC and their Impact on \\n\\nShared Future of Mankind” \\n\\nWe gather here to reflect on the achievements of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nand to chart the course of its future phase under the \\n\\nvisionary framework of the Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative (BRI). Today we are in the month of July \\n\\n2024. If you go back 11 years in this month, on \\n\\nJuly 5, 2013, the first MOU was signed between \\n\\nthe two countries. On July 5th, a three-page \\n\\ndocument was signed in Beijing, and no one knew \\n\\nabout the Belt and Road Initiative at the time, and \\n\\nno one knew about the CPEC or what it would \\n\\nlook like. But with the great effort of both sides leadership in the past 11 years, through the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a huge success has been achieved in Pakistan. 11 \\n\\nyears before no one knows that what would what was going to happen after one decade. In one \\n\\ndecade, through the Belt and Road Initiative, more than 1 billion dollars of investments have \\n\\nbeen made by China throughout the world in more than 3,000 projects. And out of those, \\n\\nPakistan succeeded in completing more than 26 billion projects. \\n\\nIn Pakistan, out of which 16 projects worth 166 billion dollars of energy projects have been \\n\\ncompleted, approximately eight projects worth 6 billion dollars have been completed, which \\n\\ninclude the KKH motorway, the Orange Line train, and others.Then, around five projects in \\n\\nGwadar Port as well as in the Free Zone worth 0.5 million have been completed in one decade. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n27 \\n \\n\\nFor social and economic development, approximately nine projects worth 0.5 million have been \\n\\ncompleted in this time frame, so last year, to celebrate the decade of CPEC, especially the vice \\n\\npremium  we hold the conference  the decade of CPEC conference where all the dignitaries have \\n\\nparticipated and everyone shed light on the progress China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nhave achieved so most of you people have a very clear idea that in the phase one what we have \\n\\nachieved and but now it\\'s time for the phase two of CPEC the recent visit of prime minister of \\n\\nPakistan to China the we had a like a business Forum in China where more than 20 MOUs have \\n\\nbeen signed between the Pakistani Enterprises and the Chinese Enterprises those show interest of \\n\\nChinese investor to invest in Pakistan. \\n\\nSo the first focus in the first decade was only on the energy and infrastructure needs so today I \\n\\nwe can easily say that we already have enough energy in our system and we have enough good \\n\\nconnectivity of Gwadar port and road \\n\\nthat we can we are ready to move from \\n\\nfirst phase to second phase. In the \\n\\nsecond phase, the top priority is \\n\\nindustrialisation. Both governments \\n\\nhave already identified nine special \\n\\neconomic zones throughout Pakistan, \\n\\nand out of those nine special economic \\n\\nzones, four are the most prioritised, \\n\\nlocated in each province. \\n\\nFor example like in we have the Rashakai special economic in KPK, Allama Iqbal Industrial City \\n\\nzones in Punjab we have economic zone  we have Dhabi special economic zone in Sindh and in \\n\\nbaluchistan we have Bostan Industrial Zone economic zone. So these four SEZs are prioritised \\n\\nSEZs, and we, the current government, are really working hard to provide all the basic \\n\\nnecessities in those SEZs to attract maximum Chinese investment as we are moving forward with \\n\\nfive new corridors in phase two of CPEC, and those five corridors are named growth corridor \\n\\ngreen corridor, livelihood corridor, innovation corridor, and openness corridor. So these five \\n\\ncorridors will be the guiding principles for the second phase, and for example, for the growth \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n \\n\\ncorridor in the next phase, the more focus will be on the growth strategies and how to improve \\n\\nPakistan\\'s growth. \\n\\nNow the government\\'s current strategy is to improve their imports and exports towards China, \\n\\nand that includes the agriculture product project. In the last year, many protocols have been \\n\\nsigned, including the cherry from this year that Pakistan made in Pakistan, growing Pakistan. \\n\\nCherry is important, and we are also trying to negotiate for the fresh meat export to China, so the \\n\\nopportunities are big, and we all have to work really hard to achieve them all to attain the \\n\\nmaximum out of these opportunities. To keep in view these opportunities, the CPEC ambitions \\n\\nand scope have been enhanced. In the beginning, we had only four areas of cooperation, but now \\n\\nwe have 11 areas of cooperation.  \\n\\nThese new areas include science and technology. Information technology and social economic \\n\\ndevelopment agriculture, international cooperation, and industry cooperation, so these new areas \\n\\nwill provide new input to the CPEC Phase 2, and we are very hopeful that through the CPEC \\n\\nPhase 2, we will be able to achieve more progress in terms of country exports and their impact \\n\\non the livelihood of the local people because phase one was focused more on infrastructure \\n\\nthings and through phase one as well. Pakistan created more than 250,000 direct jobs and a much \\n\\nbigger number of indirect jobs in Pakistan through the first phase, but for the second phase, the \\n\\nnumber is huge if we are able to achieve those targets, especially in the industrial and  special \\n\\neconomic zones. \\n\\n Key Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Over the past 11 years, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has achieved \\n\\nsubstantial progress, with investments exceeding $26 billion in Pakistan alone.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 With the completion of essential energy and infrastructure projects in the first phase, CPEC \\n\\nis now entering its second phase. The focus is shifting towards industrialization, with nine \\n\\nSpecial Economic Zones (SEZs) identified across Pakistan.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The scope of CPEC has expanded from four to eleven areas of cooperation in Phase Two. \\n\\nNew areas include science and technology, information technology, social and economic \\n\\ndevelopment, agriculture, and international cooperation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n29 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The second phase of CPEC introduces five new corridors designed to guide Pakistan’s \\n\\nsustainable development.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The government\\'s strategy includes enhancing exports, such as fresh agricultural products to \\n\\nChina, which will positively impact local livelihoods and contribute to economic stability. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. David Haruna Mrisho, Head of Department of Public Relations and \\n\\nMarketing, University of St. Augustine, Tanzania & Director East African Research \\n\\nCenter for a Community with Shared Future \\n\\nI wish to thank the organizers of this very beautiful event, and in a very specialwhereby we sit \\n\\ndown and discuss issues pertaining to the building of a \\n\\nworld that finds peace, harmony, and prosperity \\n\\ntogether, having discussions on how the community of \\n\\na shared future is a necessity towards building a better \\n\\nworld. My reflection and talk today centers on the \\n\\nStrategic significance of community of future what it \\n\\nmatters and what it means for Africa and maybe in this \\n\\nvery in a very specific way my country Tanzania. \\n\\nWhen I was trying to think about why humans need a philosophy or a path towards a better \\n\\nworld, the history of humanity came into my mind. Humans in history have witnessed not so \\n\\nmuch of a good history. Human history, for the most part, is the history of wars; it is the history \\n\\nof mysteries; it is a history of economic instability; we have the history of poverty; the history of \\n\\nsocial and political turmoil; neverless, humans in a search for the best possible arrangement that \\n\\ncan save as a panacea for the problems of humanity. \\n\\nWe witnessed today civil wars in Europe we witness today. We still witness today some red \\n\\nmeans of imperialism and even more some ideas of imperial conquest, and we witness today \\n\\nmuch of the human trade of dehumanisation and a sheer exuberance of selfishness by powerful \\n\\nempires and Leaders in this world even when, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, we never \\n\\ncreated an International System of Justice. We never created democratic global governance, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n \\n\\nfreedom, and equity, but rather a more dictatorial global system with the United States emerging \\n\\nat the so-called International Policedictating what they should do and what they should not do, \\n\\nsuch creation further divided the world, identifying some states as allies and some as partners \\n\\nand friends.  \\n\\nToday, we have hope, and we see a better future because of a new concept called the concept of \\n\\nbuilding a community of a shared future. This concept has become a better gift to humanity, an \\n\\nalternative to altering the cause of historical global turbulence and providing a framework for the \\n\\nworld to be a better place and for humanity to be rescued. \\n\\nI, along with so many of us, thank the head of state of the People\\'s Republic of China,  President \\n\\nXi Jinping, an intellectually and philosophically modern leader who fits the platonian description \\n\\nand prescription of leaders that can transform and change the world. He has initiated initiatives \\n\\nthat are not only beneficial for Chinese people but to the entire human race. He introduced the \\n\\nconcept of building a shared future back in 2013 and aimed at fostering a new type of \\n\\ninternational relations based on mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. The \\n\\nconcept emphasises the importance of building a harmonious and prosperous world through \\n\\ndialogue, consultation, and cooperation among nations regardless of their size, strength, or stage \\n\\nof development, my dear colleagues. This concept is a vision of a world where all countries can \\n\\ndevelop and prosper together, a world where there is peace, stability, and common development. \\n\\nThe concept is based on the principles of mutual respect and equality. \\n\\nMutual benefit and peaceful existence are good, constructive paths. This is a good rationale \\n\\nbehind building a community of mankind in which the community is open to each other. The \\n\\ncommunity thinks about inclusivity—a community that is clean and beautiful with lasting peace, \\n\\nuniversal security, and shared prosperity. The strategic guide of this concept is implementing the \\n\\nglobal development initiative, the global security initiative, and the global civilisation initiative, \\n\\nand therefore becoming a platform for action towards which the world becomes a better place. \\n\\nThe community of a shared future is one that allows developing countries to work together to \\n\\nmake the pie of the global economy bigger and share it with fairness so as to make development \\n\\nboth adequate and balanced and help people of all natures in all countries of all walks of life \\n\\nembark on a journey to modernisation. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n31 \\n \\n\\nThe model community of a shared future provides Africa with the opportunities to navigate this \\n\\ntraditional cycle of production to learn and share experiences with China for a prosperous \\n\\ncontinent that will fit in this great community. Africa should learn from China through some \\n\\ntechnological breakthroughs through research and development, and replication should refine \\n\\nAfricans to fit in this community. Export growth should be consolidated for African countries \\n\\nthrough massive \\n\\nindustrialisation with partnership and cooperation with China. The realization of the above goals \\n\\nhas to go with political feasibility and Readiness to transform and fit in this community with a \\n\\nshared future but this cannot be enhanced without considering who are there to belong for the \\n\\nfuture the Young Generation and this is the reason why the East African Research Center exist \\n\\nnot only to discuss and share the prosperity and the beauty of such a community but to teach the \\n\\nYoung generation why and how this philosophy is important we were established way back 2020 \\n\\nwith other close to 18 centers globally. Our intention is turning to the young people to the \\n\\nstudents and instilling them why development is important why peace is important. \\n\\nTanzania should believe in its own capacity to develop without coping with the world. We do \\n\\npresentations and workshops, but we are trying to teach our students the need for dialogue, \\n\\nstarting with workshops and conferences on religious dialogue. We teach how important it is for \\n\\nour people to know about gender issues, but much more importantly, we believe leadership is \\n\\nkey to promoting and teaching our students. \\n\\nThrough the centre on leadership, above all, we do research pertaining to what can be better \\n\\nhandled when we think about emulating our world together.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Building a global community of shared future focuses on mutual respect, fairness, and win-\\n\\nwin cooperation as a solution to the divisive and anarchic global systems currently in place. \\n\\nThis initiative, which promotes harmonious international relations through dialogue, \\n\\nconsultation, and cooperation. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The concept of a shared future provides Africa with the chance to break free from traditional \\n\\ncycles of underdevelopment.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 By learning from China\\'s technological advancements and industrialization, African nations \\n\\ncan achieve greater economic prosperity and modernization, ensuring that the continent plays \\n\\na significant role in the global community. \\n\\nSpeech by Mr. Awais Manzur Sumra, Secretary Planning, Ministry of Planning, \\n\\nDevelopment and Special Initiatives, Government of Pakistan \\n\\nTopic: “Expectations and Objectives for Phase-II of CPEC under the Framework of BRI” \\n\\n \\n\\nIt is a great honour to be here today at the International Conference on CPEC, enhancing the \\n\\ncommunity with a shared \\n\\nfuture for mankind. We \\n\\ngathered here to reflect on \\n\\nthe achievements of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic \\n\\nCorridor (CPEC) and to \\n\\ncharge the course for its \\n\\nfuture phases under the \\n\\nvisionary framework of the \\n\\nBelt and Road Initiative \\n\\n(BRI). The journey of the \\n\\nCPEC began in 2013. Over the past decades, we have witnessed remarkable milestones that have \\n\\ntransformed the economic landscape of Pakistan. CPEC phase one focused primarily on \\n\\naddressing the immediate needs of our nation by incorporating energy into the national grid, \\n\\nconstructing vital infrastructure projects, including motorways and highways, and developing \\n\\nand operationalizing the strategic Gwadar port. These achievements have laid a solid foundation \\n\\nfor the next phase of CPEC. As we move forward, both the Ministry of Planning in Pakistan and \\n\\nthe National Development and Reform Commission of China have launched CPEC Phase 2. This \\n\\nnew phase signifies a broader and more ambitious scope, focusing on industrial relocation, \\n\\nagricultural moderation, job creation, and the socioeconomic well-being of our people. Under \\n\\nCPEC Phase 2, five new corridors have been proposed by President Xi Jinping: the number one \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n33 \\n \\n\\ngrowth corridor, the number two livelihood-enhancing corridor, and the number three innovation \\n\\ncorridor. The fourth is the green corridor, and the fifth is the opening-up and digital connectivity \\n\\ncorridor. \\n\\nWe are preparing separate concept papers on these new economic corridors, which will provide a \\n\\nclear road map for each of these sectors. These concept papers will be consolidated for \\n\\npresentation at the upcoming joint coordination committee JCC meeting. This strategic approach \\n\\nensures that every sector is aligned with our Union for a prosperous and interconnected Pakistan. \\n\\nThe high-quality development and vision for CPEC Phase 2 is much broader in scope, which will \\n\\nnot only bring advanced manufacturing technologies to Pakistan but also create numerous jobs \\n\\nand opportunities for our youth in agricultural modernisation are another key focus area aimed at \\n\\nenhancing our food security and improving the livelihoods of our farmers through the adoption \\n\\nof cutting-edge technologies, science, and technology. \\n\\nCooperation will play a vital role in driving innovation and fostering a knowledge-based \\n\\neconomy. We are committed to creating a conducive environment for research and development, \\n\\nenabling our scientists and researchers to collaborate with their Chinese counterparts and make \\n\\ngroundbreaking advancements. In addition, we are making rapid progress on the development of \\n\\nthe Gwadar Port as well as the free trade zone. This will promote regional connectivity and \\n\\neconomic integration, positioning Pakistan as a hub for trade and commerce. The potential for \\n\\ntransporter trade with neighbouring countries like Iran, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian States \\n\\nis immense. We have already seen positive impacts with trade consignments destined for \\n\\nAfghanistan being cleared from Gwadar Port under the leadership of Pakistan. We have \\n\\ntransformed our policy from geopolitics to geoeconomics. This region aims to create a well-\\n\\nconnected, integrated region of shared destiny, harmony, and development. The ministry of \\n\\nplanning, development, and special initiatives has already initiated the implementation of the 5S \\n\\nframework, which includes exports, energy, equity, e-Pakistan, and the environment. This \\n\\nframework aligns with the five New Economic Corridors under CPEC Phase 2 to advance \\n\\nPakistan\\'s prosperity in each sector under the vision of our leadership by emphasising export \\n\\ncapabilities through enterprise development and job creation. We aim to accelerate our economic \\n\\ngrowth and uplift the living standards of our people. In conclusion, the CPEC is not just a \\n\\nbilateral project benefiting Pakistan and China. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n34 \\n \\n\\n It also has far-reaching positive impacts on the entire region. By promoting regional \\n\\nconnectivity and transport trade, we are building a future where prosperity is shared, and \\n\\ndevelopment is inclusive. The CPEC will continue to play a role in achieving this vision and \\n\\nfostering a community with a shared future for mankind. I look forward to very fruitful \\n\\ndiscussions and collaborations during this conference. Long live the Park-China friendship. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 CPEC Phase 2 signifies a broader and more ambitious scope, focusing on industrial \\n\\nrelocation, agricultural moderation, job creation, and the socioeconomic well-being of our \\n\\npeople. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The high-quality development and vision for CPEC Phase 2 is much broader in scope, which \\n\\nwill not only bring advanced manufacturing technologies to Pakistan but also create \\n\\nnumerous jobs and opportunities for our youth in agricultural modernization \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The CPEC will continue to play a role in achieving this vision and fostering a community \\n\\nwith a shared future for mankind. I look forward to very fruitful discussions and \\n\\ncollaborations during this conference. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n35 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Liaqat Ali Shah, Executive Director, Center of Excellence for CPEC, PIDE \\n\\nTopic: “Building the  Community of Shared Future for the betterment of Mankind” \\n\\nShared future for humankind or for mankind, this concept was coined back in 2012 but expressed \\n\\nat a university in Moscow by President Xi \\n\\nJinping, and later on, the diplomatic occupation \\n\\nconcept linked Chinese characteristics with \\n\\nsocialism. In the 19th National Party Congress of \\n\\n2017, the Chinese Communist Party of China \\n\\nagreed unanimously that it basically provided a \\n\\nguiding principle for development. It\\'s not about \\n\\ndevelopment in China; it\\'s about Chinese \\n\\ninteraction with the rest of the world. \\n\\nThis is the underpinning of this concept framework, or the concept of the community for \\n\\nhumankind, so I will approach this topic from a different standpoint and explain these things, but \\n\\nfrom a different perspective. So basically, the community of shared culture with humankind was \\n\\nmade up of the five principles of coexistence, which your Excellency talked about in detail. The \\n\\nfirst principle is the community of shared future with political sovereignty, and this concept is \\n\\nvery important to understand, even in international organisations. We often heard the word \\n\\nsovereignty in every country. Basically, we think every country should respect other countries \\n\\nsovereignty, but the Chinese actually take on that concept and expand on it. \\n\\nI think the size, strength, and wealth of every other country should be respected. You know the \\n\\nsovereignity of other countries and respect the dignity of that country. We speak today, there are \\n\\nsome countries who think about you know the hegemony and you know of some Western \\n\\ncountries especially United States we have often experienced we often observed they violated it \\n\\nfor their own interest but Chinese think otherwise and that\\'s why the political community is the \\n\\ncommunity of shared future with political sovereignty. That\\'s basically the guiding principle also \\n\\nfor the Chinese diplomatic community and the rest of the world. The second principle in this \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n36 \\n \\n\\nconcept is that the second aspect of this concept is community of shared future with security. \\n\\nWhen we talk about security, there are two aspects: one is traditional security and the second is \\n\\nnon-traditional security and traditional security. Normally, wars and conflicts happen, and we \\n\\ncan\\'t avoid them because you know there are some differences in certain networks, which \\n\\nbasically lead to conflicts. \\n\\nUkraine Russia-Ukraine war and other in you know other part of the world, but nontraditional \\n\\nsecurity is also very important. I think this is a common challenge to all humanity, and that is, \\n\\nyou know, food security, energy security, and ecological security, which is also you, we think we \\n\\ntalk about the climate changes. \\n\\nAll these securities are very important, and if we ignore one US security or we basically \\n\\nunderestimate the importance of one security to others, I think the global governance system and \\n\\nthe global order will not be the same.So I think we need to approach all these difficulties. you \\n\\nknow and we should coordinate some response and act is a coherent body to tackle these \\n\\nchallenges so that\\'s basically what this concept entails and this concept talks about the third \\n\\naspect of this principle is the community of shared future with economic interconnectedness and \\n\\nthat\\'s really very important. \\n\\nThat\\'s basically all ground connectivity there infrastructure connectivity, trade, investment \\n\\nconnectivity policy coordination of connectivity NBI People to People exchanges so these are \\n\\nthe different activity all of them they are important and I think in CPEC if we speak today I think \\n\\none missing link is policy coordination and the second thing is the People to People exchanges \\n\\nbetween Pakistan and China even though we there are some exchanges but I think the extent of \\n\\nthe exchange it should be more it should be multiplied and I think once people connect with each \\n\\nother mean we in the government possibly in connect with China so we have a hierarchical \\n\\nrelationship with ChinaThere will be some collaboration, so these are really important, and this \\n\\naspect and this connectivity. In this very concept we are talking about today, the fourth aspect of \\n\\nthis concept is the community of civilization.  \\n\\nChinese they understand you know we heard about you modernisation mean what is \\n\\nmodernization if a woman in Pakistan or any other country with Abaya for example  you know \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n37 \\n \\n\\neven though she\\'s educated would not be considered a modern because he doesn\\'t fit into the \\n\\nWestern values so modernization is a tend to westernism. Every region has its own civilisation, \\n\\nand it should be respected as well, so instead of forcing everybody to fit into Western values, the \\n\\nbetter would be to respect their civilisation, respect their values, respect their social system, and \\n\\nthen create harmony. \\n\\nSo this harmony and this President Xi Jinping idea of a shared future, I think, are the way for the \\n\\nworld because you may have heard about, read about, or heard about the clash of civilisations \\n\\nwhere it talks about, you know, Samuel Huntington. I don\\'t know exactly the name of the author, \\n\\nbut I think it is Phillips Huntington. He says that in the future, conflicts would not basically be on \\n\\neconomic, you know, resources; they would be on cultural differences, and disputes would all \\n\\nbasically be on differences, you know, in different cultures, so for a peaceful and lasting peace in \\n\\nthe world, harmony among civilisations is very important. \\n\\nChina you know the and the development of the renewable energy every form of renewable \\n\\nenergy I think China is basically leading in bent Hydro green hydrogen solar and so many other \\n\\nnew energy forms and why should we pollute and then reduce the emission. Now the renewable \\n\\nenergy have made viable fossil fuel is has no future in the future and for that reason I think we \\n\\nshould adopt and we should embrace the green development and I think Chinese basically with \\n\\ntheir wisdom and with their technology are providing all the means to the rest of the world.  \\n\\nIf we look at the picture with five different aspects and bring it together, bring all these pieces \\n\\ntogether. I think this is a very beautiful concept to reform the global governance system to bring \\n\\npeace and security, enjoy lasting peace, and share the benefits of development across the board. \\n\\nDefinitely, there will be some areas of interest, but through dialogue and discussion, we can \\n\\nmanage it and have a future together. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The concept of a \"Community of Shared Future for Mankind\" serves as a guiding principle \\n\\nfor international development and diplomacy. It emphasizes mutual respect for sovereignty, \\n\\npolitical cooperation, and the importance of non-hegemonic relations between nations, \\n\\nparticularly in contrast to Western dominance. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n38 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is need for enhanced economic interconnectedness through infrastructure, trade, and \\n\\npolicy coordination, especially within initiatives like CPEC. Additionally, it stresses the \\n\\nimportance of respecting cultural diversity and avoiding the imposition of Western values as \\n\\na universal standard of modernization. Harmony among civilizations is viewed as crucial for \\n\\nlasting global peace. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China is leading the way in renewable energy technologies and urges global adoption of \\n\\nthese practices to ensure sustainable development. Green energy is presented as the future, \\n\\nwith fossil fuels becoming obsolete, making it imperative for nations to embrace eco-friendly \\n\\ngrowth strategies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n39 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Waqas Anwar, Member of Infrastructure and Regional Connectivity, \\n\\nPlanning Commission \\n\\n       Topic: “Transport Infrastructure as Key to Connectivity” \\n\\nThe Vision 2025 National Transport Policy is our blueprint for achieving this goal, laying the \\n\\nfoundation for a future where all regions of our country are connected, fostering trade, \\n\\ninvestment, and growth. \\n\\nOur priorities under the Vision 2025 National Transport Policy are clear: we must accelerate and \\n\\nimplement a comprehensive program of \\n\\ntransport sector reform. This includes fast-\\n\\ntracking and continuing ongoing sector-\\n\\nspecific reforms, improving the maintenance \\n\\nand safety of our road networks, and adopting \\n\\nnew contracting mechanisms that prioritize \\n\\nsafety at every step. Safety is not just an \\n\\nafterthought; it is integral to every phase of \\n\\nour transport infrastructure projects. From the \\n\\ndesign phase to execution, safety measures will be embedded to protect our citizens and ensure \\n\\nthe long-term sustainability of our transport assets. \\n\\nA critical aspect of our strategy is maximizing the utilization of our railway network. The \\n\\nupgrades to ML-1 and ML-2, as well as improved connections to key economic hubs, are \\n\\nessential for enhancing the \\n\\nefficiency and capacity of our \\n\\nrailways. These upgrades will \\n\\nfacilitate faster and more reliable \\n\\ntransport of goods and passengers, \\n\\nwhich in turn will support economic \\n\\nactivities across the country. Our \\n\\ninvestment in urban transport \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n40 \\n \\n\\ninfrastructure will also see the development of comprehensive Urban Transport Master Plans for \\n\\nall large cities, prioritizing public transport and making our urban centers more livable and \\n\\neconomically vibrant. \\n\\nRegional and international connectivity are central to our vision. The China-Pakistan Economic \\n\\nCorridor (CPEC) and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) routes present \\n\\nunparalleled opportunities for Pakistan to integrate more deeply into the regional and global \\n\\neconomy. By leveraging these routes, we can become a hub for trade and commerce, attracting \\n\\ninvestment and creating jobs that will uplift communities across the nation. \\n\\nThe National Transport Master Plan serves as the overarching framework that interfaces with \\n\\nseveral key policies, including the National Freight and Logistics Policy, the National Aviation \\n\\nPolicy, and the National Electric Vehicle Policy, among others. This comprehensive approach \\n\\nensures that all aspects of transport and logistics are aligned with our broader national \\n\\ndevelopment goals. For example, our Road Transport Plan is largely complete, with a focus now \\n\\nshifting to maintenance and service delivery. This includes trialing and rolling out a new \\n\\napproach to Road Asset Management, which will see the restructuring of the National Highway \\n\\nAuthority (NHA) along commercial lines. \\n\\nThe introduction of a comprehensive vehicle fleet renewal program, aligned with international \\n\\nstandards, and the promotion of electric vehicles are crucial steps in modernizing our transport \\n\\nsector. These initiatives not only contribute to reducing emissions but also ensure that our \\n\\ntransport infrastructure is sustainable and resilient in the face of future challenges. \\n\\nIn the railway sector, comprehensive institutional reform of Pakistan Railways is underway. We \\n\\nare establishing a new Railway Policy Board to bring a more structured focus on services, \\n\\nseparating policy formulation, budgetary control, regulation, and management functions. \\n\\nInvestments in upgrading ML-1 and ML-2, as well as improving access to Karachi Port and \\n\\nselected dry ports, Special Economic Zones (SEZs), and other economic centers, will be vital in \\n\\nenhancing the efficiency of our rail network. \\n\\nOur vision for multimodal transport includes the establishment of a Freight and Logistics \\n\\nRegulatory Authority, the development of freight villages at dry ports and SEZs, and the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n41 \\n \\n\\nprioritization of the National Single Window for trade facilitation. By 2035, we envision that 30 \\n\\ncities across Pakistan will have developed comprehensive urban transport master plans, with \\n\\n95% of the urban population having convenient access to public transport. These investments, \\n\\ntotaling over PKR 1,080 billion from federal public budgets, will not only improve connectivity \\n\\nbut also significantly reduce transport emissions in our largest cities. \\n\\nOur pipeline infrastructure is another key focus area. Establishing and implementing a structured \\n\\nnetwork plan of new pipeline connections that link port terminals, refineries, storage depots, and \\n\\nother key economic sites will enhance the efficiency of our energy and industrial sectors. The \\n\\nconstruction of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline and the development of \\n\\nnew LNG facilities will further bolster our energy security and economic growth. \\n\\nLastly, we recognize the potential of inland waterway transport, particularly given Pakistan’s \\n\\nextensive canal system and the Indus River. A feasibility study will be conducted to assess the \\n\\nviability of utilizing the Indus River for the transportation of freight, which could offer a \\n\\nvaluable addition to our transport network. The reforms and investments outlined in our Vision \\n\\n2025 National Transport Policy will not only connect our people and regions but also propel \\n\\nPakistan towards greater economic prosperity and social development. Together, we can build a \\n\\nfuture where connectivity serves as the backbone of a thriving and resilient nation. \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The introduction of a comprehensive vehicle fleet renewal program, aligned with \\n\\ninternational standards, and the promotion of electric vehicles are crucial steps in \\n\\nmodernizing our transport sector.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We are establishing a new Railway Policy Board to bring a more structured focus on \\n\\nservices, separating policy formulation, budgetary control, regulation, and management \\n\\nfunctions. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The reforms and investments outlined in our Vision 2025 National Transport Policy will not \\n\\nonly connect our people and regions but also propel Pakistan towards greater economic \\n\\nprosperity and social development. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n42 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Prof. Dr. Sajid Rashid Ahmad, Dean, Faculty of Geosciences, University of the \\n\\nPunjab, Lahore \\n\\nTopic: “President Xi Jinping’s vision for environment friendly shared community under \\n\\nthe framework of Belt & Road Initiative” \\n\\nToday\\'s top topic is President Xi Jinping\\'s Belt and Road initiative. The goal of the global \\n\\ndevelopment strategy, which our several \\n\\nspeakers already told us about the CPEC, \\n\\nand the first phase and the second phase \\n\\nare now going on, our prime minister said, \\n\\nand now it will be started soon. But the \\n\\nmain thing is that the vision of the \\n\\npresidency in 2013 is to improve regional \\n\\nconnectivity and collaboration between \\n\\nAsia, Europe, and Africa. And there are \\n\\ntwo primary initiatives of his vision: one is the Silk Road Economic Belt, and number two is the \\n\\n21\\nst\\n century maritime Silk Road. The main thing is whether it is environment-friendly or not. \\n\\nYes, it is an environment-friendly project. This is the ancient Sill Road in China. \\n\\nThe development of an ecological civilisation and an inclusive and peaceful community are key \\n\\ncomponents of the presidency\\'s sustainability in order to create a brighter future for everybody. \\n\\nThis strategy seeks to accomplish this sustainable development while safeguarding the \\n\\nenvironment. Advanced social harmony strengthens international collaboration. These values, \\n\\nwhich represent a dedication to creating long-term prosperity, stability, and wellbeing for its \\n\\ncitizens and the global community, serve as the foundation of China\\'s domestic programme and \\n\\nforeign policy initiatives. So this is the region, and these are some of the policy guidelines we \\n\\nshould pursue for the new vision of green development and a way of life and work that is green, \\n\\nlow carbon, c circular, and sustainable. Efforts should be made to strengthen the population in \\n\\necological and environmental protection and build a sound ecosystem. We will set up a big data \\n\\nservice platform on ecological and environmental protection, and that setup means that if 150 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n43 \\n \\n\\ncountries set up their own data and shared that data, that is the big data service platform. We \\n\\npropose the establishment of an international coalition of green development on the Belt and \\n\\nRoad Initiative, and we will provide support to related countries in adapting to climate change. \\n\\n Pakistan and others will, so these are some of the principles of environmentally friendly \\n\\ndevelopment in BRI sustainable infrastructure green investment. We are all talking about \\n\\npollution prevention and control and biodiversity conservation. Water Resource Management \\n\\nenvironmental impact assessments climate change mitigationand adaptation  International \\n\\nstandards and best practices environmental governance, community engagement, social \\n\\nresponsibility monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building By adhering to these principles, \\n\\nthe BRI aims to promote sustainable development, minimise environmental impacts, and create a \\n\\nharmonious relationship between development and the natural environment. \\n\\nThe Chinese approach to green infrastructure refers to the initiative that supports the creation of \\n\\nsustainable and resilient \\n\\ninfrastructure development. This \\n\\nentails incorporating sustainable \\n\\nmaterials. Energy design \\n\\nincorporates green technology into \\n\\nthe planning and execution of the \\n\\nproject\\'s environmental standards. \\n\\nmaintain strict environmental \\n\\nstandards. investment in renewable \\n\\nenergy, endorsing investment along belt and road corridors in renewable energy sources such as \\n\\nhydroelectric, solar, and wind power. ecological conservation to mitigate the effects of the \\n\\nenvironment and Foster ecological resilience efforts should be made to conserve biodiversity, \\n\\nrestore habitats, and protect the ecosystem, and then collaboration and capacity building are the \\n\\nmajor problems in Pakistan. We should focus on these things: collaboration and capacity \\n\\nbuilding. \\n\\nPresident Xi’s vision is sustainability, followed by financial support and international \\n\\ncooperation working together to strengthen cooperation on environmental protection, the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n44 \\n \\n\\ndeployment of clean energy, and technology transfer. This is not the China-Pakistan economic \\n\\ncorridor; this is the China-Pakistan environmental corridor, because in this way we can improve \\n\\nthe environment of our country and also over areas like the Karot hydropower projects and the \\n\\nGwadar. Here is the CPEC project, so these are the three Corridors: the Central route, the Eastern \\n\\nroute, and the Western route. So up to now, it\\'s 2024. As the previous speaker already \\n\\nmentioned, how much work has been covered now that it\\'s phase two? So the project under \\n\\nCPEC infrastructure development is an industrial economic zone and telecommunications \\n\\nproject, and the main thing is the key collaborative efforts of the government-to-government \\n\\ncollaboration with international partner public-private partnership research institutions. \\n\\nAt the government level, or this CPEC level, any academia is here, and they are giving their \\n\\nresearch collaboration their research outputs because, at the University of the Punjab, we already \\n\\nhave MOUs with 25 universities in China and are already working with them. We already have \\n\\nprojects on mineral exploration and environmental, climate change, solar, and electrical \\n\\nengineering. They have the collaboration, but there is no platform where we have to give this \\n\\nresearch knowledge the same pram as community engagement, environmental organisation, and \\n\\ntechnology. \\n\\nWe just talk about the human being, but his vision is also about the ecosystem, the animals, and \\n\\nthe human beings. Everything is okay, so learn and follow best practices. We already mentioned \\n\\nmonitoring, evaluation, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. Green Technology policy \\n\\nalignment regulation. Community social development program, infrastructure expansion, and \\n\\naccomplishing the strategy goals. \\n\\nIn conclusion, a big commitment to global sustainable development is seen. The second thing is \\n\\nthat China should encourage international cooperation for a cleaner, greener future by giving \\n\\nenvironmental reservation, resource conservation, and green growth the top priority. The idea is \\n\\nnot only the problem with the environment today but also a standard of global cooperation and \\n\\ncollaboration in sustainable development and under the BRI. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n45 \\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Chinese approach to green infrastructure refers to the initiative that supports the creation \\n\\nof sustainable and resilient infrastructure development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 At the government level, or this CPEC level, any academia is here, and they are giving their \\n\\nresearch collaboration their research outputs because, at the University of the Punjab, we \\n\\nalready have MOUs with 25 universities in China and are already working with them. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China should encourage international cooperation for a cleaner, greener future by giving \\n\\nenvironmental reservation, resource conservation, and green growth the top priority. The idea \\n\\nis not only the problem with the environment today but also a standard of global cooperation \\n\\nand collaboration in sustainable development and under the BRI. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMs. Maria Francesca Stainno Latin America Research Center for a Community with \\n\\nShared Future and Belt & Road Initiative, and Associate Professor at National University \\n\\nof La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina \\n\\nTopic: Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind and its Convergence with \\n\\nLatin American International Relations \\n\\nI will talk about building a community with a sure future for \\n\\nmankind and its convergence with Latin American \\n\\ninternational relations, especially from a theoretical \\n\\nperspective. \\n\\nWe are witnessing a decline of Western theories with a \\n\\ncorresponding rise of non-Western theories.‖ We also \\n\\nneeded detachment from the positivist scientific method \\n\\nthrough methodological purism, especially in the field of \\n\\nsocial sciences, where the human being is the object of investigation, not only the subject, and \\n\\nthe sciences cannot interpret it. We need an integrated human spirit in the social sciences, so we \\n\\nalso need a language change. Multidimensionality and multidisciplinarity are present, so this is \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n46 \\n \\n\\nwhy I put in contact Chinese and Latin American international relations theories. Furthermore, \\n\\nwe also need new paradigms against the so-called mainstream, so the main definition comes \\n\\nfrom the Chinese perspective and experience in international relations. I consider it a community \\n\\nwith a shared future for mankind, and I also interpreted it from a Chinese perspective, using at \\n\\nleast three methodological categories that are connected with the three main schools of \\n\\ninternational relations in China. That\\'s why I interpreted the definition of community with a \\n\\nshared future for mankind with the key expressions of relationality, human authority, and \\n\\nsymbiosis. With this explanation, the community refers to the set of states small and large that \\n\\npeacefullycoexist among them: self-relationality through our common values inspired by leading \\n\\ncountries as responsible for international order. This is the human authority perspective of \\n\\nrespecting and helping each other. This is the school of symbiosis. The idea of linking autonomy \\n\\nwith solidarity between Latin American countries according to a strategic perspective is in line \\n\\nwith the Chinese description of symbiosis and human authority as well as relationality, so the \\n\\nschool of the theory of autonomy in Latin America is very comparable with the idea of building \\n\\na community with a shared future for mankind, in fact solidarity integration, where the \\n\\nconstitution of a Latin American region implies the need for a relationality between these \\n\\ncountries that recognises the authority of one or more leaders. \\n\\n The importance of the country is not of Argentina. The Brazil axis is constitutive of the \\n\\npossibility of the inter-integration of the Latin American region in a symbiotic process that \\n\\ngenerates a series of alliances towards the construction of a new order that ensures international \\n\\nsocial justice, a concept that is very comparable to that of a community with a sure future for \\n\\nmankind.So what are the keys to strengthening this community with a shared future between \\n\\nChina and Latin America, of \\n\\ncourse, as seen in the \\n\\ncooperation approach? \\n\\nespecially in the many human \\n\\nrights topics such as poverty, \\n\\nelevation, sustainable \\n\\ndevelopment, and \\n\\ndigitalisation, with a long-\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n47 \\n \\n\\nterm approach that is very often used in Latin America. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we can\\'t have national and subnational cooperation. According to a the \\n\\nconstruction and reconstruction of the main human right concept like development people Center \\n\\napproach with new meanings in line with South experience and civilizations also building an \\n\\nalternative and evolutionary approach to the corporation like for example with Latin America-\\n\\nChina Dialogues Forum last week for example I was participate in the fourth China Forum on \\n\\npoverty and development and also we have to create our Latin American characteristics as well \\n\\nas white papers like good practices to adopt to have a more intensive dialogue with China under \\n\\na regional perspective so some converges uh both China and Latin America belong to a global \\n\\nSouth that is merging with new voice in contemporary international relations in a science . \\n\\nSo some final remarks the Chinese concept of community with a sure future for kind as \\n\\ninterpreted in the international law relations is the search for not only an alternative but also an \\n\\nevolutionary system of international relations capable of replace the demonic International \\n\\nSystem with new creative solutions and it can be only overcome throughout the construction of \\n\\ncommon actions with International cooperation based no longer to on an hostile vision between \\n\\nctates but on a communion of intention of the peoples this is the real formal Innovation brought \\n\\nabout by the community with a share future for mankind and that is why it means a \\n\\ndemocratization in international relations according to a common shared values and practices.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is need for a departure from positivist scientific methods in favor of more integrated \\n\\nand multidimensional approaches in social sciences, especially regarding the human element \\n\\nin international relations. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Latin American theories of autonomy and solidarity align with the Chinese vision of a \\n\\ncommunity with a shared future for mankind, advocating for cooperative and symbiotic \\n\\nrelationships between states. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Latin America\\'s integration efforts should reflect the principles of symbiosis and solidarity, \\n\\nmirroring the Chinese approach to international cooperation. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n48 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The concept of a community with a shared future offers a new framework for international \\n\\ncooperation based on common values, shared intentions, and mutual support, aiming to \\n\\nreplace hostile dynamics with collaborative and innovative solutions \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Tahir Hijazi, Former Member Governance, Planning Commission \\n\\nTopic: “Socio-Economic aspects of projects in CPEC Phase-I” \\n\\nIt is a privilege to address you today on the socio-economic aspects of the projects undertaken \\n\\nduring the first phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). As we reflect on the \\n\\ntransformative impact of these projects, it is essential to recognize the immense opportunities \\n\\nthey have brought to Pakistan, especially in terms of employment and economic growth. \\n\\nPakistan, as many of you know, is one of the most populous countries in the world, ranking \\n\\namong the top five globally. This youthful population is on the cusp of entering the workforce, \\n\\nand as they do, the demand for jobs will inevitably surge. The CPEC initiative, Pakistan’s most \\n\\nsignificant development project to date, has been instrumental in addressing this pressing need. \\n\\nFrom its inception, CPEC has been envisioned as a catalyst for economic development and job \\n\\ncreation in Pakistan. The Planning \\n\\nCommission projected that CPEC would \\n\\ngenerate 1.6 million jobs by 2030. While \\n\\nthis ambitious target captured the \\n\\nimagination of many, the early phases of the \\n\\nproject revealed a gap between the skills of \\n\\njob seekers and the opportunities available. \\n\\nHowever, rather than a setback, this \\n\\nmismatch has served as a call to action—prompting us to align our educational and vocational \\n\\ntraining programs with the needs of a rapidly evolving job market. Despite these early \\n\\nchallenges, the impact of CPEC on employment in Pakistan has been profound. The \\n\\ninfrastructure and energy projects completed under CPEC Phase-I have not only enhanced the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n49 \\n \\n\\nnation’s physical and economic landscape but have also directly created approximately 70,000 \\n\\njobs. These opportunities have been vital in reducing unemployment and have had a ripple effect \\n\\nthroughout the economy, contributing significantly to Pakistan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \\n\\nMoreover, CPEC’s influence extends beyond the borders of Pakistan. The project has also \\n\\ngenerated employment in China, both directly and indirectly, showcasing the mutual benefits of \\n\\nthis landmark initiative. The economic linkages forged through CPEC have strengthened the \\n\\nbond between our two nations, creating a framework for shared prosperity and regional stability. \\n\\nIt is crucial to understand that the socio-economic benefits of CPEC are not limited to job \\n\\ncreation alone. The infrastructure \\n\\nimprovements brought about by \\n\\nCPEC have had a transformative \\n\\neffect on Pakistan’s economy. The \\n\\nenhanced road networks, upgraded \\n\\nports, and improved energy supply \\n\\nhave not only facilitated commerce \\n\\nand trade but have also provided a \\n\\nsolid foundation for future industrial growth. These developments have attracted investment, \\n\\nboth domestic and foreign, creating a more dynamic and competitive economic environment. \\n\\nThe reduction in unemployment and the subsequent economic growth have also had positive \\n\\nsocial implications. As more people find gainful employment, we see improvements in living \\n\\nstandards, better access to education and healthcare, and overall enhanced quality of life. CPEC \\n\\nhas, in many ways, been a driver of social progress, helping to uplift communities across the \\n\\ncountry. \\n\\nLooking ahead, the lessons learned from Phase-I of CPEC will be invaluable as we move into the \\n\\nnext phases of the project. It is imperative that we continue to focus on skills development and \\n\\ncapacity building to ensure that the Pakistani workforce is equipped to meet the demands of a \\n\\nrapidly changing job market. By doing so, we can maximize the socio-economic benefits of \\n\\nCPEC, ensuring that the fruits of this partnership are shared widely and equitably. The socio-\\n\\neconomic impact of CPEC Phase-I has been overwhelmingly positive. The jobs created, the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n50 \\n \\n\\ninfrastructure built, and the economic growth stimulated by these projects have laid a strong \\n\\nfoundation for Pakistan’s future.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Planning Commission projected that CPEC would generate 1.6 million jobs by 2030. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The economic linkages forged through CPEC have strengthened the bond between our two \\n\\nnations, creating a framework for shared prosperity and regional stability. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The enhanced road networks, upgraded ports, and improved energy supply have not only \\n\\nfacilitated commerce and trade but have also provided a solid foundation for future industrial \\n\\ngrowth. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Prof. Dr. Muhammad Saleem Mazhar, Director General, National Language \\n\\nPromotion Department, Government of Pakistan \\n\\nTopic: “Promoting Cultural Diversity among nations for a Harmonious shared future for \\n\\nMankind” \\n\\nI am thankful that you have provided me with the opportunity to say something about this. It is \\n\\nan established fact that individuals, societies, and \\n\\nstates develop understanding, become closer, and \\n\\nsharehappiness and sorrows with each other \\n\\nthrough cultural relations. Language literature \\n\\nFine Arts paintings and music are the main \\n\\ncomponent of culture which facilitates all types \\n\\nof relations and helps in developing friendships \\n\\nbetween different societies. It is only and only \\n\\nthe culture that attracts individuals that attracts \\n\\nand includes all and does not allow anyone to go. It is why states establish cultural relations with \\n\\nother states in order to create understanding between them and serve humanity. Because of these \\n\\nrelations, man-to-man contacts are established, and it is culture that becomes the basis of all ties, \\n\\nlike social, economic, political, financial, and technological. Culture converts strangers into \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n51 \\n \\n\\nfriends; it separates love and peace. Harmony tolerance respects differences of opinion and \\n\\ninspires people to follow the coexistence principle without any discrimination based on colour, \\n\\ncaste, or creed. There is no doubt that in this era of globalisation connectivity and information \\n\\nflow, no individual or society can survive in isolation. The lynchpin of all developments and \\n\\nprogress is creating understanding between societies and nations, which leads to an enlightened \\n\\nmoderate respectful of the moral, ethical, social, and cultural values of a particular nation. \\n\\nNations and states have become the keys to success and progress for a nation. The Asian region, \\n\\nwith its young, hardworking, and talented youth population and area, is rich in terms of its \\n\\nhuman and natural resources, capital, and intellectual analysts. Experts in international relations \\n\\nare unanimously of the view that the 21st century is the century of the rise of Asia. The very \\n\\nrapid development and progress of China are provided, proving this fact that the Asian region \\n\\nand China\\'s inclusive and collaborative approach to policy formation and execution is making \\n\\nwonders. China\\'s rapid progress in all fields is exemplary at the present time. China\\'s ancient \\n\\ncivilization Chinese have presented three very essential and valuable gifts to the world and \\n\\nHumanity these are invention of compass printing press and paper that have provided with the \\n\\nbase for socioeconomic development in coming centuries at present times China is working \\n\\nenthusiastically for socioeconomics cultural and civilizational development of the world in order \\n\\nto serve humanity and create Harmony in all societies. The belt and Road initiative (BRI) and \\n\\nChina Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) is Corridor of peace and prosperity for all China\\'s \\n\\nVisionary leadership has reached to this golden principle and conclusion and aim and objective \\n\\nthat the only way of progress is in Sharing resources supporting helping supporting and helping \\n\\neach other to contribute towards a vibrant tolerant Society therefore they have presented concept \\n\\nof community with shared future. \\n\\nIt is appreciable that for the last 35 years China has not fired a single bullet from its s to any \\n\\nstate; it is separating peace, harmony, and prosperity at Globe. China has very clearly explained \\n\\nseveral times that it respects and regards all cultures and has no intention to interfere in any \\n\\nculture or tradition related to any nation or society. Pakistan and China are time tested friends of \\n\\nall times their sincere friendship is an example for the whole world in the era of BRI and CPEC.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n52 \\n \\n\\nThere is need of time to strengthen cultural literary and academic relations between both the \\n\\nnations to achieve this cultural artists academicians researchers and students exchange programs \\n\\nmay be started universities of both the country should start joint teaching programs and initiate \\n\\njoint research projects to address the problems and issues being faced by the regional countries \\n\\nparticularly Pakistan and China hope this cultural cooperation and academic collaboration will be \\n\\nhelpful for the development of the region which will not only be a win-win situation for both the \\n\\ncountry but will but will serve Humanity \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The very rapid development and progress of China are provided, proving this fact that the \\n\\nAsian region and China\\'s inclusive and collaborative approach to policy formation and \\n\\nexecution is making wonders. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan and China are time tested friends of all times their sincere friendship is an \\n\\nexample for the whole world in the era of BRI and CPEC. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China is working enthusiastically for socioeconomics cultural and civilizational \\n\\ndevelopment of the world in order to serve humanity and create Harmony in all societies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n53 \\n \\n\\nKeynote Speech by Senator Sarmad Ali \\n\\nTopic:  “The job of Media in enhancing regional connectivity and the framework of Belt & \\n\\nRoad Initiative” \\n\\nIt is an honour for me to be here today and to talk about the role of media in the Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative (BRI), which is based on five \\n\\nconnectivities: policy coordination, \\n\\ninfrastructure connectivity, \\n\\ninterconnected trade, financial \\n\\nintegration, and connectivity. \\n\\nHowever, the most important is the \\n\\npeople to people connectivity, it is not \\n\\npossible to bring people together \\n\\nunless we create another connectivity \\n\\nwithin this connectivity, which is media-to-media connectivity, and linkages are actually the \\n\\nbedrock of people-to-people connectivity and the success of BRI and global initiatives. \\n\\nIn today\\'s world, where the flow of information has no boundaries, media plays a very important \\n\\nrole in shaping perceptions for fostering understanding and building cultures. It is imperative that \\n\\nthe media and the BRI partner countries join hands in countering negativity in media. Whoever \\n\\ngets whatever share controls the minds of the people and controls the minds of the media, has the \\n\\nability to shape this real state through shaping our beliefs and forming new truths and \\n\\nperceptions, thus becoming reality, perceptions are actually our reality. Whatever we may say, \\n\\nwhatever we may believe in, but whatever we see, whatever we perceive, unfortunately, in our \\n\\nworld becomes reality.   \\n\\nIt is not what is truth or what is false; it is our perception of whatever we see around us that \\n\\nmakes us believe in it, and we believe we can turn it into reality while the global media has \\n\\njoined forces against the BRI and, of course, CPEC being part of the BRI and often call it the \\n\\nnew form of colonialism. We should come together on one platform to not just counter their \\n\\ntactics but also highlight the true image and spirit of BRI and its plans, milestones, achievements, \\n\\nand way Forward. We talk about G2G connectivity, we talk about B2B connectivity, we talk \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n54 \\n \\n\\nabout g2b connectivity, but I think there\\'s another connectivity that we forget about when we talk \\n\\nabout connectivity, and that is M2M connectivity, or media-to-media connectivity, in today\\'s \\n\\nworld of fake news and disinformation. \\n\\nIt becomes imperative to have similar points of view from around the world get to one point and \\n\\nmay their presence be felt. We live in a world that is dominated by CNN and the BBC of the \\n\\nWorld. Whatever they tell us becomes reality, whatever they tell us becomes truth, and we do not \\n\\ngive our point of view; we do not give our version of truth out there that is also somewhere out \\n\\nthere, but we do not push it; we do not talk about it. And the BBC of the World is using the \\n\\npower of media to change the image of PR. They\\'re using it because they share perceptions, they \\n\\nshare perceptions of the world constantly by hand. \\n\\nPakistan is one of the most important, having 7–8% of the BRI, which is one of the \\n\\nmost important corridors of the Belt and Road Network, why can\\'t we do something to bring \\n\\nmedia outlets to Pakistan and organise the media summit of BRI countries and try to use the \\n\\npower of the media of these countries to counter whatever is being built around BRI and is being \\n\\ntalked about in the West? The power of the media force lies in its ability to transform perceptions \\n\\ninto realities into convictions. Such cooperation will help inform, entertain, educate, and \\n\\ninfluence the people of these countries. So let us use the power of media to foster understanding, \\n\\npromote transparency, and counter misinformation in these countries to enable them to realise \\n\\nthe full potential of this infrastructural and transformative initiative. Otherwise, this will get lost; \\n\\notherwise, we will remain in debating what CPEC is doing for Pakistan and what BRI is doing \\n\\nfor other countries. There is a constant debate going on, and we keep hearing people questioning \\n\\nwhether we should have been part of CPEC or not, or whether CPEC should have been started or \\n\\nnot. \\n\\nBut where are those alternatives going? That is something that we need to sit down and ponder, \\n\\nwhether it is it is whether it is even whether there is even a need to question, um, what is \\n\\nhappening in CPEC, and this can only be done if media gets together. If media in Pakistan gets \\n\\ntogether with media in China with media in other parts of BRI, this can only happen when we \\n\\nbring them all together.  In today\\'s world, it is more true than it was 10 years ago, 15 years ago, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n55 \\n \\n\\nor 20 years ago. Today, perception makes us what we are. Today, perception makes the world \\n\\nsee us for who we are. \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 In today\\'s world, where the flow of information has no boundaries, media plays a very \\n\\nimportant role in shaping perceptions for fostering understanding and building cultures. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We talk about G2G connectivity, we talk about B2B connectivity, we talk about g2b \\n\\nconnectivity, but I think there\\'s another connectivity that we forget about when we talk about \\n\\nconnectivity, and that is M2M connectivity, or media-to-media connectivity. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 It is imperative that the media and the BRI partner countries join hands in countering \\n\\nnegativity in media. We should come together on one platform to not just counter their tactics \\n\\nbut also highlight the true image and spirit of BRI and its plans, milestones, achievements, \\n\\nand way Forward.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n56 \\n \\n\\nSpeech byProf. Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal, Dean Social Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, \\n\\nIslamabad \\n\\nTopic: “Global Security Initiatives and its Impact on World’s Geo-Political Situation” \\n\\nWhen we look at the transformation in global politics, we find that there\\'s been a big transition \\n\\ntaking place. Western unipolarity is \\n\\ngiving way to multipolarity, and \\n\\nPresident Xi and President Putin \\n\\nare very determined in these global \\n\\ndynamics. So when we look at \\n\\nthese American and Chinese \\n\\nstrategic contests, we find that they \\n\\nare very much influencing global \\n\\npolitics. Recent developments \\n\\nindicate that Beijing is determined \\n\\nto prevent washing political military arrangements to check China\\'s. \\n\\nAnd in this context, the American Chinese have come up with their global strategic vision, or \\n\\nwhat we call their global security initiative. I\\'m going to address two questions: first, what is the \\n\\nGlobal Security Initiative and how do we look at it?; and second, how has the has the Global \\n\\nSecurity Initiative received and responded to by the International Community? Having said this, \\n\\nthe vision and efforts for global development, peace, and security through diplomacy and \\n\\neconomic cooperation are enshrined in three international initiatives. 2022 Global Security \\n\\nInitiative, or prior to that, 2021 Global Development Initiative, and then follow up last year, \\n\\n2023 Global Civilisation Initiative. All these initiatives are very much, you can say, overdue, but \\n\\nthe Global Security Initiative makes a lot of difference. What is the primary concept of this \\n\\nglobal security initiative? It advocates the concept ofindivisible security and that no single \\n\\nnation\\'s security should come at the expense of others. This concept of invisible security we had \\n\\nalready seen when there was a sinking accord between the Russians and the Americans in 1975 \\n\\nduring the Cold War, and trustingly, when we trace the Global Security Initiative Evolution or a \\n\\nbackground, we find that the Chinese have been working on it. For instance, in 1997, they came \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n57 \\n \\n\\nup with the concept of the new security concept, later referred to as universal security and \\n\\nincreasingly as invisible and cooperative security, which was promoted to the centrality of the \\n\\nUnited Nations and the United Nations Charter, emphasising the multipolarity of multi-security \\n\\narchitectures, cooperation dialogue, and giving a way against collective security. It advocates six \\n\\ndifferent ways precisely when we look at it, but the most important emphasis of this global \\n\\nsecurity initiative is that to emphasise and work according to the United Nations Charter, it\\'s \\n\\nvery interesting, just as what the liberalist economic world or liberal democratic world after 1945 \\n\\narticulated. \\n\\nNow President Xi is articulating through his Global Security. In this context, when he was \\n\\nemphasising the Cyber Security United Nations Charter, at the same time it was bridging a gap \\n\\nbetween traditional and non-traditional security and advocating to address through consensus \\n\\nnew emerging challenges or existing challenges like terrorism, climate change, cyber security, \\n\\nand biosecurity. I think it\\'s a big thing when we talk about biosecurity in modern times. He wants \\n\\na nuclear war that cannot be won and must never be fought; therefore, there\\'s a need to have a \\n\\nGlobal Security Initiative (GSI) that opposes the Cold War mentality of unilateralism and blocks \\n\\nconfrontation and hegemony. \\n\\nIn this context, when we look at this dialogue, we find that after the initiative, we have seen the \\n\\nChinese do good work when there was a report engineered by the Chinese in March 2023 \\n\\nbetween Saudi Arabia and Iran. In this Global Security Initiative (GSI), they have also \\n\\nrecommended in 2022 and again when it was republicized Concept in 2023 two-state solution \\n\\neven of a Palestine crisis even prior to the start of the Gaza war in October, so by this way we \\n\\ncan find that they also recommended Russian and Ukrainian settlement through the dialogue \\n\\nanyway. Now my second part is global development and how the world is moving and where we \\n\\nadjust it. I think this era of soft power or too much using \\n\\nIt has disturbed the Western Nations because they interpreted GSI as a challenge to the Western-\\n\\nled global governance system and an alternative to us. The International World Order Global \\n\\nSecurity Initiative is a component of a larger push to establish a post-Western multiple world and \\n\\nset global agendas that reflect the interests and values ofLike other great powers, China pursues \\n\\nthe national interest, but as a rising superpower, it also seeks to establish its global leadership. It \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n58 \\n \\n\\ndelegitimizes a collective and highly material security approach, so unlike the United States \\n\\nsecurity order, the Global Security Initiative links security with development and emphasises \\n\\nnon-traditional security issues. But what is the outcome of this conflict? \\n\\nPresident Xi Jinping announced the Global Security Initiative, so when I look at these things, \\n\\nwhat is my understanding of them? China\\'s Global Security Initiative seems benign for the \\n\\nnation\\'s diplomatic, economic, and civilizational progress because it cultivates a network of \\n\\nfriendly international and regional relationships, second only to the Cold War mentality. \\n\\nRegional global hegemonies’ and power politics threaten world peace and prosperity; therefore, \\n\\nthe Global Security Initiative is a remarkable work against the militaristic policies of the United \\n\\nStates and Allies. \\n\\nGSI emphasised partnership for alliances and advocates that the disputes could be resolved \\n\\nthrough dialogue instead of use of force, for therefore it\\'s in the best interest of the nations, \\n\\nincluding Pakistan, which is very much advocating neutrality in international politics. My final \\n\\npoint here is that it is equally important to prevent the escalation ofconflict at five nuclear flash \\n\\npoints. So GSI is good to prevent conflict at the first nuclear flash point, which we call Kashmir. \\n\\nIt\\'s good to prevent the second Korean penuela and the and the third Ukrainian penuela. \\n\\nEuropean flash point fourth Taiwan and fifth Gaza War My final submission is that the Global \\n\\nSecurity Initiative (GSI) also supports United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which \\n\\ndemands the use of UN legislation domestic laws for the prevention of chemical, biological, \\n\\nnuclear, and logical terrorism within the state or preventing these kinds of weapons from falling \\n\\ninto the hands of non-state actors. Finally, I can say the Global Security Initiative (GSI) is a good \\n\\nway to address traditional and non-traditional security challenges in global politics. \\n\\n Key Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The ongoing shift in global politics from Western unipolarity to a multipolar world. This \\n\\ntransition is largely driven by strategic contests between the United States, China, and \\n\\nRussia, with China\\'s Global Security Initiative (GSI) emerging as a key framework for \\n\\nshaping the new global order. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n59 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Global Security Initiative advocates for \"indivisible security,\" where the security of any \\n\\ncountry is linked to the security of others in the region. This principle opposes the notion that \\n\\none nation\\'s security can come at the expense of another, promoting a cooperative approach \\n\\nto global security issues. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Global Security Initiative is seen as an alternative to the Western-led global governance \\n\\nsystem. It links security with development, addressing both traditional and non-traditional \\n\\nsecurity challenges such as terrorism, climate change, and cybersecurity.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The importance of the GSI in preventing the escalation of conflicts, particularly at nuclear \\n\\nflashpoints like Kashmir, the Korean Peninsula, Ukraine, Taiwan, and Gaza. The initiative \\n\\nadvocates for resolving disputes through dialogue rather than force, and it supports the \\n\\nimplementation of international resolutions like UN Security Council Resolution 1540 to \\n\\nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Prof. Dr. Anwar Ahmed, Sector Specialist, Planning Commission \\n\\nTopic: “Agricultural Cooperation and Food Security” \\n\\nPakistan has 225 million people, with 60% of the of the population below the age of 30, and it is \\n\\na blessing that we can do much with this 60% \\n\\npopulation. It is also very important because \\n\\nit has tremendous potential for global \\n\\ninvestors and companies, has the largest \\n\\nirrigated land, is the centre of China, India, \\n\\nand the Middle East, where we have several \\n\\nopportunities, and is the home of Asian \\n\\ncivilisation and some of the highest and most \\n\\nbeautiful ranges as well. \\n\\nPakistan is a blessed country, and if we see that in every livestock sector, Pakistan\\'s GDP is \\n\\n1/5th, which is generated from agriculture and livestock. We are 12th in buffalo, third in goats, \\n\\nfourth in cotton production, and fifth in sugarcane production. We are ninth in wheat and sheet. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n60 \\n \\n\\nIt is a great opportunity for Pakistan to harvest the potential of CPEC. The livestock sector in the \\n\\nnational economy is also contributing a lot because we have a wide population of livestock in \\n\\npottery. We can attract private sector investment of 1.05 per trillion in pottery and similar levels \\n\\nin the daily and lead sectors. There is opportunity for over 2 million people for employment as \\n\\nwell as mechanics for primary resources for investment, but having such potential here is the \\n\\ngrowth pattern, and we are having a declining trend in agriculture as regards the GDP and crops \\n\\nof the sector.  So why are we declining? Here are some challenges: we have low productivity in \\n\\nagriculture, a high import bill, low profitability and competitiveness, and low diversification. We \\n\\nhave only five major props. degraded land resources and natural resources, as well as declining \\n\\nin the rural sector in terms of trade and equity implications. We have poor technology adoption, \\n\\nbut we have opportunities in the form of modern technology for Grand Revolution 2.0, which is \\n\\nthe prime minister initiative that just started this year. Our institutional reforms are not opening, \\n\\nand the current government has started some Prime Minister initiatives regarding food security, \\n\\nwhich are generated by the IPC integrated food security phase classification, in which we are \\n\\nfalling on a medium food in a city or country. \\n\\nIt is the global perspective of the current food system and what are the future challenges that our \\n\\npopulation is expanding and we need much food for them as well. We need to prevent \\n\\nagriculture from expanding because of the potential we are harvestingis not sufficient uh the \\n\\nhidden potential which is much more higher than the actual potential of our uh agriculture \\n\\ngrowth so in this context following friends are shaping our future food system then there is \\n\\nclimate change we are evolving consumption preferences and in nutrition and health rapid \\n\\ntechnological change and innovation as well as localised development and strong stakeholder \\n\\nengagement and demographic changes. these are the driving forces which are achieving our \\n\\nfoodSecurity here is the Nexus of Agriculture, Energy, and Water, which is a catastrophe \\n\\nforPakistan and we are being behind in achieving this. We need food, we need water, and we \\n\\nneed energy to run to achieve the intended objectives.  \\n\\nThis is another social dilemma that poses major challenges to food and security in Pakistan. \\n\\nRising population urbanisation is diversifying diet patterns. increased food demand as well as \\n\\nrising food pricespurchasing power-falling water tables Low irrigation efficiency increases \\n\\nsoilErosion, as well as climate change depleting water reserves, is also a big challenge. Limited \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n61 \\n \\n\\nland availability, food losses, and food-based products are the major challenges and inefficient \\n\\ndiversification of foods. Now, what is an option for us? That is, the technological development in \\n\\nthe world. We are seeing innovations in food packagingtechnology, new methods of food \\n\\nproduction such as 3D printing, as well as the application of automation, artificial intelligence, \\n\\nbig data, and blockchain technology. \\n\\nThese are the recent options for us, so smart irrigation is the innovative technology, which we \\n\\ncan use to save our irrigation water. Drone technology is also coming to agriculture, and we are \\n\\nusing drones to spray our fields in urban agriculture. We also have a new trend that if we utilise \\n\\nurban agriculture, we can Harvest our house-level V vegetables and fruits, and uh, there are new \\n\\nsources of foods coming. For example, edal insect cell-based food production technology as well \\n\\nas the production of SE, or macro-forming of shellfish protein, is also entering our food chain, \\n\\nand insects are amazing as well as altering meat. In spite of alternate meat, we are using the \\n\\nvegetables, and our food scientists are changing those vegetables into the shape of meat that \\n\\ntastes just like meat, and it is a new development.For example, we have the economic zones; if \\n\\nwe develop them and link them with the villages, we have a great potential for trade as well as \\n\\nexport tourism opportunities. organic farming management and the and the adoption of water-\\n\\nsaving techniques marketing of crops, employment opportunities promotion of rice exports every \\n\\nLogistics cotton processing units productivity of the livestock sector tobacco value chain palm \\n\\noil production portal, industry development, and range lands. \\n\\nThe new initiatives, which can be developed through CPEC, give us a bright future now that this \\n\\ngovernment is a sector special in the Planning Commission of Pakistan. I have gone through all \\n\\nthese projects that we are doing for our food security. For example, just the prime minister of \\n\\nPakistan started a solarization of agriculture project in Pakistan, whose total cost is 377 billion \\n\\nrupees. All the provinces that have participated agreed on this project, and its authorisation has \\n\\nbeen done. It will be started in the next month with another project, Green Revolution 2.0. \\n\\n It is a prime minister initiative that proposes intervention for Green Revolution 2.0. It is a $5 \\n\\nmillion project and it will supply machinery demand; it will give demonstrations to farmers for it \\n\\nwill raise nursery kitchen gardening; capacity building and linkage will be developed; and \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n62 \\n \\n\\nlivestock will be given to social mobilisation and establishment of endowment funds through \\n\\nPRC. The Pakistan Agriculture Research Council will be developed for research in agriculture. \\n\\nIts total cost is 5 billion rupees. The cluster development programme, which is also a prime \\n\\nminister initiative, and in which the concept of food cluster agriculture cluster was studied in the \\n\\nPlanning Commission, in which the clusters were identified as mango Citrus  Apple, apricot, \\n\\ntomato, potato, onion, garlic, and different districts of all the provinces of Pakistan have been \\n\\nidentified in which these interventions will be delivered, and technological interventions are \\n\\nprocessing capacity building, research, and development in agriculture. These are the new PSDP \\n\\nprojects on food security; a unit of research and development has been introduced in the \\n\\nministry; establishment of the Pakistan animal identification and crossability system; national \\n\\nprogram on animal disease surveillance; national agriculture productivity; management \\n\\nprofessionals; national multi-sectoral nutrition program; establishment of Pak-Korean nutrition  \\n\\nMore than 137 billion hectares of livestock have been approved for the province of CPEC. \\n\\nExport initiatives should be taken, as well as skill development, and CPEC should be utilised for \\n\\nR&D development as well as export development. The 5D framework has a significant potential \\n\\nto achieve these objectives of shared future. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan, with its vast irrigated lands and significant livestock sector, holds tremendous \\n\\npotential for agricultural growth and investment. Despite being a leading producer of various \\n\\ncrops like cotton and sugarcane, Pakistan\\'s agriculture sector is currently underperforming \\n\\ndue to challenges such as low productivity, poor technology adoption, and declining \\n\\nprofitability. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Technological advancements such as smart irrigation, drone technology, automation, \\n\\nartificial intelligence, and new methods of food production (e.g., 3D printing and cell-based \\n\\nfoods) are seen as key to overcoming Pakistan\\'s agricultural challenges. These innovations \\n\\noffer opportunities to improve productivity, reduce resource use, and introduce sustainable \\n\\nagricultural practices. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The government has launched several initiatives to bolster food security and agricultural \\n\\ndevelopment. Projects like the Green Revolution 2.0, solarization of agriculture, and various \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n63 \\n \\n\\ncluster development programs aim to enhance productivity, promote sustainable practices, \\n\\nand develop export-oriented agriculture. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a critical framework for driving \\n\\ninvestment, research, and development in the agricultural sector. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech byDr. Fouzia Hadi Ali, Director, Regional Integration Centre, University of the \\n\\nPunjab, Lahore  \\n\\nTopic: “Impact of Shared Economic Development for building a community with shared \\n\\nfuture” \\n\\nMy discussion and my speech rest on where we are. Rightly said, TV is very below it when it \\n\\ncomes to different indexes, and one of the grave \\n\\nthings that you can see is in the Sustainable \\n\\nDevelopment Index. Pakistan is also in the 2024 \\n\\nIndex Report on Number 137. So the thing is, when \\n\\nit comes to Pakistan and the opportunities lying \\n\\nbetween in terms of the China-Pakistan Economic \\n\\nCorridor and the kind of aspect that we are deficient \\n\\nupon,. \\n\\nPeople would agree that we have to conduct a gap \\n\\nanalysis to see what we\\'re good at, what we\\'re doing, what we have to learn, and what we have to \\n\\nfill in that gap. May we offer something we\\'re good at and something we have to learn from \\n\\nothers, especially from the projects that are going on, and the biggest if you can see the foreign \\n\\ndirect investment comes from China? \\n\\nSo the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) advocates a little bit more. I know that you \\n\\nmust have your own perspective. We stand at a crossroads of  history,  Our world is more \\n\\ninterconnected than ever before, we face challenge the threat to divide us to an end complex one \\n\\nprinciple shine brightly a beacon of hope and progress is shared economic development.This \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n64 \\n \\n\\nprinciple is not just an economic strategy but a vision for building a community with a shared \\n\\nfuture. Building a community with a shared future is often associated with cooperative and \\n\\ninclusive development strategies that aim to create mutual benefits for all participants. When it \\n\\ncomes to shared economic development, this concept emphasises collaboration, interdependence, \\n\\nand equitable growth. \\n\\nThe first thing that we have to look into is the pooling of resources by sharing resources. \\n\\nKnowledge and technologies Communities can achieve more significant economic growth. \\n\\nImagine the power of combining our innovation and expertise to create more efficient production \\n\\nsystems, springing local industries, and making us more comparatively marketable.In 2020, \\n\\nglobal GDP will grow by just 3.5 percent because of the pandemic. But we have seen a lot of \\n\\nsurge in the IT-based industry during the same pandemic because lots of physical businesses \\n\\nswitched over to a more online system, and there were certain opportunities from the \\n\\nuncertainties that existed.Then again, one of the aspects relates to the shared economic \\n\\ndevelopment allowance for risk diversification. \\n\\nEconomic shocks in one area can be mitigated by the stability and growth in another. Leading to \\n\\noverall economic silence. Think of it as a safety net, a show assuring that one part of a \\n\\ncommunity faces challenges and others can provide support for strong stability. This is essential \\n\\nfor building resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation, as highlighted in the inclusive \\n\\nInnovation Infrastructure SDG 9. \\n\\nOver the past decades, one of \\n\\nthe aspects relates to the \\n\\nreduction of inequality. If you \\n\\njust look at our region \\n\\nthrough Central Asia, \\n\\nPakistan, and most of the \\n\\ncountries around us, if you \\n\\njust look at the population, \\n\\nhalf of the population is male \\n\\nand female, but when it \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n65 \\n \\n\\ncomes to the participation of women in economic activity, it\\'s negligible. So that means that \\n\\nwhere the economy has a lot of female participation, their economic growth could even be \\n\\namplified. So that\\'s something that we have to contemplate and think about. \\n\\nThen, this can also reduce income and opportunity dispersion within communities. So Than We \\n\\nCan Talk About As It Was Mentioned About Higher Education Also That a Higher Education is \\n\\nan important and pivotal Aspect Relating to Bringing Innovation So the Problem Arises Before It \\n\\nComes To Pakistan Instead of actually comparing innovation with the US and UK, of course we \\n\\nare very, very far behind, and I think it will take as long as Another year may be two and the \\n\\nsummer may be gone, and we\\'re still striving towards them, but the thing we can do is what I \\n\\nsuggest, and I have been suggesting a number of times. \\n\\nOur industries are far behind in terms of the skill level that is required, if you just look at the \\n\\nbiggest exporting areas. For instance, we are exporting a lot of sports products, but when you just \\n\\ngo and look into the industries, they are not up to the mark of the international standards, which \\n\\nmeans \\n\\nWe can invite different trainers from different countries, especially China, and we can actually \\n\\nstart working together with the academics, and they can provide the platform. There is an extra \\n\\nexpense for the government to cover. Because it can be a win-win situation where trainers could \\n\\nuse the platform at the university level, youth are already there, and you just need to make a \\n\\nconnection with them. \\n\\nSocial cohesion and trust are, of course, two of the biggest challenges, as Doctor Jaspal said \\n\\nabout the security aspect. You know the biggest challenge is that we are far behind; we are \\n\\nproviding security facilities; and we are our biggest investors who are providing us with FDI. \\n\\nYou\\'ve seen a number of things that have happened and that have made us quiet, but certain \\n\\ninsecurities among the Chinese counterparts have prevented us from continuing with the project \\n\\nas well. So one of the important aspects is conflict reduction, and that can be done only if we are \\n\\nmore connected. The more economic activity we can do with regional countries, the better we \\n\\ncould be, and everybody would know that we are economically connected with each other. If \\n\\nthere is a conflict, it will be harmful for everybody. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n66 \\n \\n\\nThe instance was a talk about the environment: that we have to adopt green technology \\n\\nconservation efforts and policies because, as you know, when it comes to climate issues, we are \\n\\nfacing a lot of smog, a lot of global warming issues are turning up, and we\\'re witnessing more \\n\\nfloods and a lot of other things. That\\'s where we have to collaborate with the regional countries \\n\\nto address this. This is the basic underlying reason behind facing true climate issues. So one of \\n\\nthe aspects has already been discussed: cultural exchange and understanding. Of course, \\n\\ninnovation and creativity can be spread if diverse people from diverse institutions and regions \\n\\ncombine together and actually develop a global citizenship where we learn from each other, their \\n\\nwork ethic, and how people learn to work together.  \\n\\nThe vision of the honourable President of China also offers this global development initiative \\n\\n(SDI), also related to the sustainable development initiative, and that\\'s where I think that by \\n\\npromoting inclusive growth, prosperity, social cohesion, understanding, and strengthening \\n\\npolitical-economic ties. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Shared economic development is not just an economic strategy but a vision for creating a \\n\\ncommunity with a shared future. This approach emphasizes collaboration, interdependence, \\n\\nand equitable growth, allowing communities to pool resources, knowledge, and technologies \\n\\nto achieve more significant economic progress and resilience. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Opportunities lie in leveraging initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nto fill gaps in skills, technology, and infrastructure, potentially transforming the country\\'s \\n\\neconomic landscape. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan\\'s industries need to elevate their standards to meet international levels, which can be \\n\\nachieved through collaborations with foreign trainers and academics. This would enhance the \\n\\nskill levels required in key exporting sectors, ultimately boosting the country\\'s global \\n\\ncompetitiveness. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Additionally, addressing environmental challenges like climate change and smog requires \\n\\ncollaboration with neighboring countries to adopt green technologies and conservation \\n\\nefforts, ensuring sustainable development for all. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n67 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Najeeb Ullah, Former Member, Science and Technology \\n\\nTopic on: “CPEC Phase-II and Socio-Economic Development through Technological \\n\\nAdvancements” \\n\\nThe neo-classical growth model is very important, and according to the neo-classical growth \\n\\nmodel, there are three components: K \\n\\nand L. A means the knowledge part; A \\n\\nmeans the higher education; a means the \\n\\nhidden part, which you might not see; \\n\\nit\\'s not the infrastructure.According to \\n\\nthis model, if you invest in knowledge, \\n\\nthere will be growth. The second part is \\n\\nthe k, which means the FBI, the foreign \\n\\ndirect investment, and the capital. If \\n\\nthere is capital, there will be growth. \\n\\nThen the third and last one is the L skill labour. If you have three components: education, quality \\n\\nhigher education, the hidden part, capital, and the skill labour, we can expect growth, and if one \\n\\nof the parts is missing, forget about innovation, forget about economic growth. That\\'s his \\n\\nstatement, not my statement.  \\n\\nMoving on to MIT, one of the best universities in the world, they say the innovation ecosystem \\n\\nhas five components rather than three, and these five components are the universities, then the \\n\\ngovernment, then the private corporate sector. These were called the emerging Tri triple helix \\n\\nmodel, and now they have added two more. One is the capital landscape; it\\'s very important, but \\n\\npartiality is completely missing in Pakistan, and then along with this one is the mindset of the \\n\\nentrepreneurs. If you have these five components, there will be a knowledge-based economy, \\n\\nthere will be an economy, and there will be economic growth.So I would like to talk about these \\n\\nfive components today, and now let me tell you where we stand in innovation. We are in the 88th \\n\\nposition in the world. Innovation is not one component.  \\n\\nInnovation is one of the five components, and these are all cross-linked to get about innovation \\n\\nand economic growth. According to the GII, these are called the innovation inputs.What are \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n68 \\n \\n\\nthese five? The first one is the institution. These institutions are the political environment, the \\n\\nstability; these are the regulatory environment; and these are the business environment. If these \\n\\nare there, things will grow; the second one is called human capital and research education. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the tertiary education is the higher education, and along with this one, it\\'s \\n\\ncovered with the R&D model. The next one is the infrastructure, the ICT, and then the fourth one \\n\\nis the market sophistication, the capital, the investment, and then the last one is the business \\n\\nsophistication, the knowledge work. As I mentioned, that\\'s basically the skill label, and then \\n\\nbasically there are two outputs now. 5.5 in the region, I\\'m talking about India, 4%. \\n\\nSo that\\'s why you always see that there should be 4% for education, but that\\'s \\n\\ntherecommendation that rather than the 2% it should be 4% see the missing links now that\\'s the \\n\\ngovernment part that\\'s not me that\\'s not universities the second one this one the gross expenditure \\n\\nof the R&D is very important see now this is only 164 and again when I was at the it was very \\n\\nalarming 64% nothing so what we say what we recommend that it should be at least 1% the \\n\\nleading in the world my example Israel is 6% was 6% already and we just1 6% see that\\'s these \\n\\nthe figures next. \\n\\nand they have done very well, I mean relatively well, so they have actually awarded some of the \\n\\ngrants. That\\'s a good point, but then see that the IC, as I mentioned, is one of the very important \\n\\nparameters. We are gradually at one of three positions out of 132; they\\'re at the bottom, so we \\n\\nhave to rectify the ICT infrastructure, the investment, the internet speed, the internet access, and \\n\\nthen basically what we see is actually the Venture Capital Fund. Nowadays, people don\\'t believe \\n\\nin the banking system. I will share with you what the new landscapes are for the venture \\n\\ncapitalism and the private equity fund. It\\'s nothing, 81% of the GDP, and then basically, it\\'s the \\n\\nknowledge employment. We are at the one2 position in the technical employment, which means \\n\\nwe don\\'t need engineers because we don\\'t have the technical, uh, private corporate sector. \\n\\n So that\\'s why basically that\\'s very alarming unless and until we see in all dimensions things will \\n\\nbe missing because if you are producing engineers and if there is no technical need for the \\n\\ncorporate tech enterprises this is where we are to so it should be two-way traffic now talking \\n\\nabout the outputs and in the output I think we are at the 43 position that\\'s the huge index because \\n\\nof the higher education since 2002 they\\'ve invested a lot and I think that\\'s one of the good \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n69 \\n \\n\\nposition we are rank at 43 position but what is the impact of this Edge index what is the impact \\n\\nof this research.  \\n\\nIt\\'s very important to know that there are basically these four levels: one is the concept level of \\n\\nthe product, the second is the development, then the pre-commercialization and early \\n\\ncommercialisation, and then the scale. the big companies 1 billion and you need different levels \\n\\nof investment in this in Pakistan.  \\n\\nI can say this in comparison to the UK and America then the Venture Capital fund I have \\n\\nVenture Capital is almost zero and then we don\\'t have the big investment in private Equity funds \\n\\nand we don\\'t have the loans for Innovation as it is in New America so we have only one part the \\n\\nsmall part of the ground and that\\'s we always talking about the concept nothing is coming out \\n\\nunless and until we transfer the capital landscape and that should be at the Strategic level of the \\n\\ncountry or the province we will not move but that\\'s the first harsh reality we have to change it let \\n\\nme tell you the figures in UK it\\'s 24 29.4 billion pounds the private equity and Adventure Capital \\n\\nfunds and then so on and see the Red Zone in Pakistan it\\'s only $74 million so no comparison at \\n\\nall.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 According to the neo-classical growth model, economic growth hinges on three key \\n\\ncomponents: knowledge (education and innovation), capital (foreign direct investment), and \\n\\nskilled labor. These elements must be present for sustained economic development, \\n\\ninnovation, and technological advancement. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is the for a comprehensive innovation ecosystem, which includes universities, \\n\\ngovernment support, private sector involvement, capital availability, and an entrepreneurial \\n\\nmindset. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan faces significant challenges in its technological and innovation sectors, including \\n\\ninadequate investment in research and development (R&D), poor ICT infrastructure, and a \\n\\nlack of venture capital.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 For Pakistan to achieve significant socio-economic development through technological \\n\\nadvancements, there must be a strategic focus on transforming the capital landscape \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n70 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Mufti Muhammad Naeem Rehmat Naeemi, President, Muttahida Ulema \\n\\nCouncil Pakistan \\n\\nTopic:  “Interfaith Harmony and Peace for the shared future of Mankind” \\n\\nDuring his speech, Mufti Muhammad Naeem Rehmat Naeemi focused on the theme of \\n\\n\"Interfaith Harmony and Peace for the shared future \\n\\nof Mankind,\" highlighting the importance of \\n\\npromoting unity, understanding, and cooperation \\n\\namong different religious communities for the \\n\\nbetterment of society and the world at large. His \\n\\nspeech emphasized the significance of mutual respect, \\n\\ntolerance, and dialogue in fostering interfaith \\n\\nharmony and peaceful coexistence, particularly in the \\n\\ncontext of initiatives such as the China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) that aim to enhance connectivity and collaboration between nations. \\n\\nPakistan is making significant progress, and we will continue to do so, InshaAllah. Our esteemed \\n\\nulema have emphasized that interfaith harmony is a key blessing, especially in the context of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). We have worked across the six provinces of \\n\\nPakistan, recognizing that a nation is built upon two pillars: the country and its religion.As \\n\\nPakistanis, we are a unified nation, embracing both our identity and our faith. We are Muslims, \\n\\nand alongside us, Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Sikhs are our brothers. Together, we represent \\n\\nthe beautiful diversity of Pakistan. If there is peace in our land, our roads will flourish, and \\n\\nprosperity will be visible everywhere. \\n\\nIt is the responsibility of our ulema to spread the message of mutual coexistence. When a person \\n\\nearns a degree, they also take on the duty to protect the wealth, lives, and respect of all people, \\n\\nregardless of their background. We must strive to bring all communities together.Interfaith \\n\\nharmony is essential for the success of CPEC, as it unites people from all walks of life. Our \\n\\npartnership with China is a testament to our brotherhood, and we must fulfill our responsibilities \\n\\nas humans and as Muslims. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n71 \\n \\n\\nFrom our institute, 375 individuals have completed training and earned commissions in the army. \\n\\nWe are prepared to contribute and support the growth and development of Pakistan. Together, \\n\\nwe will build a brighter future for our nation. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Interfaith harmony is essential for societal peace and national prosperity. The mutual \\n\\nrespect, tolerance, and dialogue among different religious communities are crucial for \\n\\nfostering unity and peaceful coexistence. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 It is responsibility of religious scholars (ulema) to promote messages of coexistence and \\n\\nharmony. Ulema must guide their communities to protect the rights and respect of people \\n\\nfrom all backgrounds, ensuring a peaceful and inclusive society. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Unity and cooperation among diverse communities are vital for the flourishing of China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects and the overall development of the nation. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The importance of collective efforts including those of trained individuals from religious \\n\\ninstitutions, in supporting Pakistan\\'s development and securing a prosperous future for all \\n\\ncitizens. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n72 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Chief Guest His Excellency Faisal Karim Kundi,  \\n\\nGovernor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province \\n\\n \\n\\nDuring his speech, Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, H.E Faisal Karim Kundi described CPEC as \\n\\na game changer that will \\n\\nrevolutionize the industrial sector \\n\\nand create new growth \\n\\nopportunities. He acknowledged the \\n\\npivotal role of President Asif Ali \\n\\nZardari in CPEC\\'s inception and \\n\\nhighlighted the project\\'s potential to \\n\\ntransform the lives of millions \\n\\nthrough technological collaboration \\n\\nwith China. Governor Kundi \\n\\nreaffirmed the time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan and expressed optimism about \\n\\nCPEC\\'s positive impact on the regional economy. \\n\\n \\n\\nToday, I am honored to speak about the transformative project that is an instrumental initiative in \\n\\nthe Pakistani socioeconomic landscape, and I would like to share these achievements and \\n\\nimpacts. It is profound to gather at the International Conference on CPEC: Enhancing \\n\\nCommunity with a Shared Future for Mankind. Before you note, just to highlight the \\n\\nachievements of the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor to reform, our enduring duty is to create \\n\\na transformative framework to harness Pakistan\\'s demographic and natural resources.  \\n\\n Balance the regional socioeconomic development and prosperity of our regions. Improving \\n\\npeople lives, focusing on poverty reduction, education, and healthcare ،promotes domestic peace \\n\\nand stability, fostering a secure environment for investment. This ambitious project aims to boost \\n\\nregional connectivity, develop transnational logistics and infrastructure, and increase trade with \\n\\nSouth Asia, Central Asia, and beyond.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n \\n\\nIt also encompasses people-to-people exchanges, economic cooperation, and technology transfer \\n\\nto strengthen our strategic partnership. Strengthening the Pakistan-China relationship, the bond is \\n\\na historic, time-tested friendship. Today, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a \\n\\ntestament to an enduring partnership, highlighting our shared aspirations for a prosperous \\n\\nfuture. CPEC symbolizes our shared vision for a bright future. One that is built on the principles \\n\\nof mutual respect, trust, and cooperation. Through CPEC, we are not only connecting our \\n\\neconomies but also people, cultures, and histories. We are creating a shared future that is \\n\\npromoted on the principles of equality, justice, and sustainability.  \\n\\nThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has achieved numerous milestones, contributing \\n\\nto sustainable Pakistani socioeconomic growth. Some key achievements in infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment include the include \\n\\nthe construction of modern \\n\\nhighways, motorways, and ports, \\n\\nwhich enhance connectivity and \\n\\nemphasize trade.The development \\n\\nof power plants and energy \\n\\nproduction addresses the country\\'s \\n\\nenergy needs. Industrial \\n\\nexpansion, which is the \\n\\ndevelopment of special economic \\n\\nzones (SEZs), attracts investment and promotes industrial growth.  \\n\\nCPEC has played a vital role in strengthening the Pakistan economy, improving the lives of its \\n\\ncitizens, and enhancing its global standing. We appreciate China\\'s support and look forward to \\n\\ncontinuing cooperation for mutual benefits. I\\'d like to take this opportunity to express my sincere \\n\\ngratitude to the Chinese government and people for their unwavering support and cooperation. \\n\\nWe have achieved remarkable milestones, and we look forward to continuing our cooperation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has achieved numerous milestones, \\n\\ncontributing to sustainable Pakistani socioeconomic growth. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 CPEC has played a vital role in strengthening the Pakistan economy, improving the lives of \\n\\nits citizens, and enhancing its global standing. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 CPEC symbolizes our shared vision for a bright future.

This \\n\\nplatform supports building \\n\\nshared culture and arts, \\n\\nenhancing people-to-people \\n\\ncontacts through tourism and \\n\\ntrade, fostering regional \\n\\nconnectivity through initiatives \\n\\nlike the Belt and Road Initiative \\n\\n(BRI) and the Eurasian Region, and promoting research cooperation.PRCCSF calls for closer \\n\\ncoordination between research institutes in Pakistan, China, and other regional countries to pave \\n\\nthe way for joint ventures in multiple areas of mutual interest. We are dedicated to advancing the \\n\\nconcept of a community with a shared future, as championed by President Xi Jinping. Our center \\n\\nhas won the Outstanding Individual Contribution Award from CUC as the top research center \\n\\nglobally for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023. \\n\\nIn addition to our focus on enriching research on various aspects of Pakistan-China relations, \\n\\nPRCCSF is deeply involved in significant regional and global developments. Our platform for \\n\\ndialogue and exchange strives towards enhanced cooperation and synergy between the media and \\n\\nacademic communities. The primary aim of organizing this conference is to raise awareness \\n\\nabout the concept of community of shared future and how it is linked with CPEC. We should be \\n\\nsteadfast in our commitment to forging a human community, working towards a shared future for \\n\\nall of humanity. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n \\n\\nChina has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared futures with firm \\n\\nconviction and solid actions. This includes promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, \\n\\nimplementing the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global \\n\\nCivilization Initiative, and proposing a range of regional and bilateral initiatives aimed at \\n\\nbuilding communities with shared futures. More countries and people are coming to understand \\n\\nthat this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, \\n\\njustice, and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better \\n\\nworld.Together, we can achieve remarkable milestones in our shared journey towards enhancing \\n\\nour community with a shared future for mankind.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Professor Li Huailiang, Dean of the Institute for a Community with Shared \\n\\nFuture, Communication University of China (CUC), Beijing, China \\n\\nDear guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour for me to join you in this important UH \\n\\nconference to discuss the CPEC and the building of a global community of shared futures as an \\n\\nimportant pilot project of the Belt and \\n\\nRoad Initiative (BRI). The CPEC has \\n\\nmade remarkable achievements since \\n\\nits launch. It has not only promoted the \\n\\neconomic development of China and \\n\\nPakistan but also made positive \\n\\ncontributions to regional peace, \\n\\nstability, and prosperity. Through the \\n\\nCPEC, we see great potential for \\n\\ninfrastructure connectivity. The \\n\\nconstruction of roads, ports, and energy projects has created more favourable conditions for trade \\n\\nand investment, promoted industrial upgrading and transformation, and brought tangible benefits \\n\\nto the two peoples. However, the CPEC is much more than that; it is a vivid practice of building \\n\\na global community of shared futures. In the era of globalisation, countries face many common \\n\\nchallenges, such as climate change, public health security, and even economic development. To \\n\\nbuild a global community of shared futures, we must transcend national boundaries and work \\n\\ntogether to meet this challenge. The successful experience of the CPEC tells us that common \\n\\ndevelopment can only be achieved through openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit. \\n\\nWe need to strengthen policy communication. promote trade and investment liberalization. \\n\\npromote the free flow of capital, technology, and talent and create a more fair, transparent, and \\n\\npredictable business environment in order to practice the concept of building a global community \\n\\nof shared futures. The Communication University of China (CUC) established the Institute of \\n\\nGlobal Community of Shared Future in 2019. The academy is a strategic research platform and a \\n\\nunit directly under the university; its mission is to conduct theoretical research and international \\n\\nspread of the concept of the global community of shared future. Since its establishment, the \\n\\nInstitute has achieved fruitful research results. As the concept of a global community of shared \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n14 \\n \\n\\nfutures has been widely recognised in the international community, we have found many friends \\n\\nin the international academic community and established 20 international research centres in \\n\\nAsia, Europe, Africa, America, and Latin America. The Pakistan Research Centre of the Global \\n\\nCommunity of Shared Futures is one of the best of these 20 research centres. \\n\\nUnder the leadership of Mr. Khalid Pakistan Research Centre for a Community with Shared \\n\\nFutures (PRCCSF) has made outstanding contributions to the dissemination of the concept of the \\n\\nglobal community of shared futures in Pakistan and around the world. Pakistan Research Centre \\n\\nfor a Community with Shared Futures (PRCCSF) has been the top-ranking centre for the last \\n\\nthree years. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Khalid. \\n\\nAcademic exchange is an important part of people-to-people and cultural exchange, which can \\n\\nenhance mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples. We hope that through \\n\\nmore cooperation in academic, cultural, and educational fields, we can narrow the distance \\n\\nbetween the two countries and lay a solid public opinion foundation for the long-term \\n\\ndevelopment of China-Pakistan relations. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The CPEC has not only promoted the economic development of China and Pakistan but also \\n\\nmade positive contributions to regional peace, stability, and prosperity. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The successful experience of the CPEC tells us that common development can only be \\n\\nachieved through openness, inclusiveness, and mutual benefit. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is need to strengthen policy communication. promote trade and investment \\n\\nliberalization. promote the free flow of capital, technology, and talent and create a more fair, \\n\\ntransparent, and predictable business environment in order to practice the concept of building \\n\\na global community of shared futures. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n15 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Muhammad Asim Khan, Head of Development Communication, Ministry of \\n\\nPlanning, Development and Special Initiatives, Government of Pakistan \\n\\nTopic:  \\u201cIntroduction to Conference objectives and key Highlights \\n\\nIt's really an honour and privilege to address you today. Our gathering today reflects our shared \\n\\nvision and commitment to exploring the \\n\\nimmense potential of the China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nand its role in fostering a brighter future \\n\\nfor our communities and beyond. I'm \\n\\nparticularly honoured to have a long \\n\\nassociation with the China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC). Since its \\n\\ninception, I have had the privilege of \\n\\nwitnessing the signing of its framework agreement in 2015 and serving as its \\n\\nfirst spokesperson for the Belt and Road initiative launched by the honourable president Xi \\n\\nJinping. This conference aims to achieve the following objectives: highlight the strategic \\n\\nsignificance of CPEC, discuss historical context strategic goals, and transform the impact of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on regional and global skills. Second, review key \\n\\nachievements and milestones to reflect on the progress made during phase one and to analyse the \\n\\nsignificant infrastructural and energy projects that have been commissioned. Third, discuss \\n\\ncurrent and future energy projects to explore the ongoing and future energy projects that are vital \\n\\nfor sustainable economic growth and development. The fourth objective is to promote \\n\\ncooperation and collaboration to foster a dialogue on industrial relocation, transport \\n\\ninfrastructure, environmental challenges, and The fifth goal is to enhance socioeconomic \\n\\ndevelopment and connectivity. Our conference is structured into three key sessions, each \\n\\naddressing critical aspects of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). In session one, we \\n\\nwill be discussing the strategic significance and infrastructure development of the China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). This session will provide a comprehensive overview of the \\n\\nhistorical background, strategic goals, and key milestones achieved in Phase 1, and it will also \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n16 \\n \\n\\ncover the significant energy project that have been installed and their impact on the region and \\n\\nthe well-being of the people of Pakistan. In the second session, we will be discussing cooperation \\n\\nunder the framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and we will have a \\n\\nspecial focus on the cooperative framework of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). \\n\\nThe topics of discussion will include industrial relocation progress on transport infrastructure \\n\\nprojects, environmental challenges and opportunities, and challenges associated with special \\n\\neconomic zones. In the third session, we will be discussing socio-economic development and \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) phase two for regional connectivity. Our final \\n\\nsession will explore socioeconomic development and regional connectivity under China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) Phase 2, and the key topics will include new corridor proposals for \\n\\nagricultural cooperation, cultural exchange, and socioeconomic challenges and opportunities for \\n\\nregional integration. \\n\\nWe expect a few key takeaways for all of the participants, like an in-depth understanding of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework and the achievements till now, as well as \\n\\nnetworking opportunities like engaging with experts, policymakers, and stakeholders to foster \\n\\ncollaboration and build partnerships. Thirdly, insights into the best practices learned from case \\n\\nstudies and discussions on \\n\\nsuccessful projects and \\n\\ninitiatives. Under the China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor \\n\\n(CPEC), similarly, we will \\n\\nlearn about how policy \\n\\nrecommendations contribute to \\n\\nthe development of actionable \\n\\npolicy recommendations for \\n\\nsuccessful implementation of \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects. Last but not least, we expect innovative \\n\\nsolutions, like exploring innovative solutions to address the challenges and leverage \\n\\nopportunities presented by the CPEC. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n17 \\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We will learn about how policy recommendations contribute to the development of \\n\\nactionable policy recommendations for successful implementation of China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) projects. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We expect innovative solutions, like exploring innovative solutions to address the challenges \\n\\nand leverage opportunities presented by the CPEC. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Guest of Honor His Excellency Ambassador Jiang Zaidong, Embassy of the \\n\\nPeople's Republic of China to Pakistan \\n\\nMinister Ahsan Iqbal, to the host of the conference, and to all the distinguished guests, \\n\\nforsupporting China-Pakistan \\n\\nfriendship and also your commitment \\n\\nto the great cause of building a \\n\\ncommunity with a shared future for \\n\\nmankind. Today, my speech will \\n\\nfocus on three main aspects: how \\n\\ndoes China handle state-to-state \\n\\nrelations based on the Five Principles \\n\\nof Peaceful Coexistence, how does \\n\\nChina build the world through the \\n\\nVision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind, and how does China \\n\\npractice this through high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and the CPEC construction. \\n\\nFirst, as the Chinese saying goes, be kind to your neighbor, and promote harmony among all \\n\\nnations.The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have provided a historical answer to the \\n\\nvery important question of how to properly handle state-to-state relations. On 28th June , the \\n\\nConference Marking the 70th Anniversary of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence was \\n\\nheld in Beijing. President Xi Jinping attended the conference and delivered an important speech. \\n\\nPresident Xi expounded on the essence of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and their \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n18 \\n \\n\\nrelevance for our times, which was highly endorsed by all parties present. Seventy years ago, \\n\\nagainst the backdrop of national independence and liberation movements swept across the globe \\n\\nin the wake of the Second World War, and the scourge of hot wars and the confrontation of the \\n\\nCold War, Chinese leaders put forth in full the following Five Principles, i.e. mutual respect for \\n\\nsovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in each \\n\\nother\\u2019s internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Five \\n\\nPrinciples have been included in a series of important international documentsover the past 70 \\n\\nyears, and have been widely recognized and observed by the international community. They \\n\\nhave become open, inclusive, and universally applicable basic norms for international relations \\n\\nand fundamental principles of international law.  \\n\\nThey have set a historic benchmark for international relations and international rule of law, \\n\\nserved as the prime guidance for the establishment and development of relations between \\n\\ncountries with different social systems. They have been a powerful rallying force behind the \\n\\nefforts of developing countries to pursue cooperation and self-strength through unity, and \\n\\ncontributed historic wisdom to the reform and improvement of the international order. The past \\n\\n70 years\\u2019extraordinary journey proved that, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are a \\n\\ncommon asset of the international community to be valued, inherited and further promoted. \\n\\nSecond, a just cause should be pursued for common good. Building a Community with a Shared \\n\\nFuture for Mankind answered the call of the times of \\u2015what kind of world to build and how to \\n\\nbuild it\\u2016. Our world today is going through accelerated transformation unseen in a century, and \\n\\ninternational situation is going through turbulence and transformation. The Ukraine crisis and the \\n\\nPalestinian-Israeli conflict have been been dragging on. President Xi Jinping put forward the \\n\\nvision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind. This vision captures the \\n\\nreality that all countries have a shared future and intertwined interests, and sets a new model of \\n\\nequality and coexistence for international relations. It responds to the world\\u2019s prevailing trend of \\n\\npeace, development, cooperation and win-win, and opens up new prospects for peace and \\n\\nprogress. It also keeps pace with the historic trend toward multipolarity and economic \\n\\nglobalization, and inspires new ways to achieve development and security.Precisely because this \\n\\nvision aligns with the shared aspirations of all nations, and charts the course for the development \\n\\nof world civilization, it has been widely welcomed by people around the world, and has become \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n19 \\n \\n\\na flag spearheading the trend of the times. This vision carries forward the same spirit of the Five \\n\\nPrinciples of Peaceful Coexistence, and is the most effective move to sustain, promote and \\n\\nupgrade the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in the new circumstances. It has and will \\n\\ncontinue to move the world to a bright future of peace, security, prosperity and progress. \\n\\nSince BRI was proposed, China has adhered to the principle of \\u2015planning together, building \\n\\ntogether, and benefiting together\\u2016, and has continuously advanced in the direction of high-quality \\n\\ndevelopment. From laying the foundation, building the structure to taking the roots, we have \\n\\ncontinuously devoted to enhancing policy, infrastructure, trade, financial and people-to-people \\n\\nconnectivity, and building a cooperation platform of extensive participation and international \\n\\nconsensus.  \\n\\nNot long ago, when met with Prime Minister Shahbaz who was paying an official visit to China, \\n\\nPresident Xi Jinping pointed out that China is ready to synergize the high-quality Belt and Road \\n\\ncooperation with Pakistan\\u2019s development plans, carry out cooperation in agriculture, mining, \\n\\nsocial livelihood and other areas in accordance with local conditions, and jointly develop \\n\\nfivecorridors featuring growth, livelihood-enhancing, innovation, green development and \\n\\nopenness, with focus on building an upgraded version of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor \\n\\n(CPEC), so as to promote deeper and more substantive progress in the high-quality cooperation \\n\\non CPEC and help boost Pakistan\\u2019s economic and social development. Under the strategic \\n\\nguidance of the leaders of the two countries, we are ready to work with Pakistan to accelerate the \\n\\nbuilding of an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era and \\n\\nlead the great process of building a community with a shared future for mankind. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The vision of Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind captures the reality \\n\\nthat all countries have a shared future and intertwined interests, and sets a new model of \\n\\nequality and coexistence for international relations. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China is ready to synergize the high-quality Belt and Road cooperation with Pakistan\\u2019s \\n\\ndevelopment plans, carry out cooperation in agriculture, mining, social livelihood and other \\n\\nareas \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n20 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China has adhered to the principle of \\u2015planning together, building together, and benefiting \\n\\ntogether\\u2016, and has continuously advanced in the direction of high-quality development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We are ready to work with Pakistan to accelerate the building of an even closer China-\\n\\nPakistan community with a shared future in the new era and lead the great process of \\n\\nbuilding a community with a shared future for mankind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n21 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Hina Shahid, Head of Department of Media Studies,  \\n\\nFoundation University, Islamabad \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cBRI as an Instrument of Global Civilization Initiative\\u201d \\n\\n \\n\\nBRI, upholds the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution, and shared benefits. We \\n\\nall witnessed that BRI follows \\n\\na Silk Road spirit featuring \\n\\npeace and cooperation, \\n\\nopenness and inclusiveness, \\n\\nmutual learning and mutual \\n\\nbenefit. It focuses on policy \\n\\ncoordination, connectivity of \\n\\ninfrastructure, unimpeded \\n\\ntrade, financial integration, \\n\\nand closer people-to-people \\n\\nties. It has turned ideas into actions and vision into reality, and the initiative itself into a public \\n\\nproduct widely welcomed by the international community. From high-level plans to intensive \\n\\nand meticulous implementation, BRI has advanced in solid steps as the world has witnessed \\n\\nhigh-quality development that bring benefits to local people, and build a global community of \\n\\nshared future. \\n\\nIf we look at the progress of last ten years, starting from the Policy coordination that is an \\n\\nimportant guarantee for this initiative, and an essential precondition for joint actions. The Belt \\n\\nand Road Initiative has been incorporated into important documents of international \\n\\norganizations including the UN Security Council Resolution 2344, calling on the international \\n\\ncommunity to strengthen regional economic cooperation through the Belt and Road Initiative and \\n\\nother development initiatives, while for the first time enshrining the concept of \\\"a community of \\n\\nshared future for mankind\\\"  more and more countries and international organizations have signed \\n\\nintergovernmental cooperation agreements on the Belt and Road Initiative thus ensuring \\n\\ncoordination and cooperation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n22 \\n \\n\\nHowever, a growing deficit in peace, development, security and governance, together with \\n\\ninterwinding conventional and non-conventional security issues such as regional conflicts, arms \\n\\nraces, food security, terrorism, cyber-attacks, climate change, energy crises, major infectious \\n\\ndiseases, and artificial intelligence problems, poses a grave threat to the beautiful planet on \\n\\nwhich all humans live.In the face of emerging global difficulties and challenges, human society \\n\\nneeds new ideas, new concepts, and a more just, equitable, balanced, resilient and effective \\n\\nglobal governance system.  China, as a responsible state, comes forward once again to introduce \\n\\nGlobal Civilization Initiative. Cultural connectivity, as championed by the GCI, encourages \\n\\ninclusive coexistence and deters aggression by promoting mutual respect and understanding. GCI \\n\\nhas inspired a new era of unity, understanding, and peaceful coexistence on a global scale. This \\n\\nvision aligns with the ethos of the BRI, which has, since its inception, aimed to revive and extend \\n\\nthe ancient Silk Road's spirit of exchange and cooperation.  \\n\\nThe GCI, alongside the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative, has \\n\\ngarnered international support as a significant public good provided by China to the world. These \\n\\nglobal initiatives reflect China's vision and foreign policy toward achieving development, \\n\\nprosperity, security, and stability worldwide, defining the path China has set to deal with \\n\\nothers.GCI aligns with the Belt and Road Initiative's goals of extending ancient exchanges along \\n\\nthe Silk Road into a modern framework. The ancient Silk Road served as a central hub for the \\n\\nexchange of civilizations, promoting trade, sharing cultures, and enhancing mutual \\n\\nunderstanding. The Belt and Road Initiative carries forward the rich legacy of the ancient Silk \\n\\nRoad, aiming to foster collaboration and cooperation among civilizations. \\n\\nThe GCI\\u2019s mission is transformational, aiming to reshape global connections by encouraging \\n\\nstates to collaborate in an atmosphere of mutual respect and understanding. This effort rejects the \\n\\nconventional concept of a \\\"clash of civilizations\\\" in favor of civilizations enhancing each other \\n\\nvia communication and trade. The GCI is founded on principles such as mutual respect, open \\n\\nconversation, and cooperative growth, all of which seek to build a sense of shared global \\n\\nprogress. \\n\\nCultural exchanges play a unique and irreplaceable role in the rejuvenation of China and the \\n\\nbuilding of a global community with a shared future. Chinese wisdom, passed down through \\n\\nmillennia, advocates for the mutual prosperity of global civilizations, welcomes the flourishing \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n \\n\\nof popular cultural products, and encourages the youth to inherit and reinvent their proud \\n\\ntraditions.  \\n\\nFor instance, cultural exchanges between Pakistan and China have significantly strengthened \\n\\npeople-to-people contacts \\n\\nbetween the two countries. \\n\\nThe cultural performances and \\n\\nartistic collaborations between \\n\\nthem have provided a better \\n\\nunderstanding of each other's \\n\\npeople and culture, fostering a \\n\\nsense of camaraderie and \\n\\nmutual respect.Let us embrace \\n\\nthis vision and work \\n\\ncollectively towards a world \\n\\nof unity, understanding, and peace.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Belt and Road Initiative has significantly strengthened people-to-people ties, artistic \\n\\ncollaborations, and cultural understanding, celebrating the richness of humanity's cultural \\n\\ntapestry and nurturing a sense of interconnectedness and common purpose. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Cultural exchanges between Pakistan and China have significantly strengthened people-to-\\n\\npeople contacts between the two countries. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Chinese wisdom, passed down through millennia, advocates for the mutual prosperity of \\n\\nglobal civilizations, welcomes the flourishing of popular cultural products, and encourages \\n\\nthe youth to inherit and reinvent their proud traditions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Mr. Zafar ul Hassan, Joint Chief Economist, Planning Ministry \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cKey Milestones and Achievements in Phase I of CPEC under BRI\\u201d \\n\\nIn the first phase, the major focus was on building infrastructure gaps, bridging the gap in the \\n\\nenergy sector, and improving highways.  In the \\n\\nsecond phase, which is more critical to bring \\n\\ninfrastructure utilising this infrastructure energy \\n\\nand translate into economic growth, SEZs are \\n\\ncritical. So far, four SEZs are almost developed, \\n\\nso this development phase is going on, so we \\n\\nhave to populate into industry. Why is it critical \\n\\nfor Pakistan to just cooperate or bring \\n\\ninternational cooperation? Pakistan is \\n\\nconsistently facing a balance of payments \\n\\nproblem, and because of this problem, after 2\\u20133 years, the economic stabilisation is being \\n\\nundertaken with the help of the IMF, which forces us to take critical decisions regarding the cost \\n\\nof energy taxation. This is also affecting the investment climate, and this is making it difficult to \\n\\nbring industries into the SEZs once the economy stabilises. Then it will be easier for the country \\n\\nto operate the industrial zone, and it will also bring the economy back on track. The bringing of \\n\\nChinese experts in different areas has recently been undertaken, and the first page of experts to \\n\\nanalyse the Pakistani structural transformation is on the way. And we will give a sectoral strategy \\n\\nfor which sector will be incorporated, and the one area that we have ignored and where a lot of \\n\\nwork is going on is the agriculture sector. \\n\\nThe cooperation in the field of livestock and agriculture is leading to the rural problem, so we \\n\\nhave to focus in the second phase on, uh, just creating jobs, and the second element, which we \\n\\nhave ignored, was undertaken during the first phase of the socioeconomic development of the \\n\\ncountry. \\n\\nDevelopment. I think it has been ignored, but I think it is not very public, but a lot of things are \\n\\nhappening, like 15,000 solar panels given to people who are not part of the national grade.These \\n\\nwere just transforming lives in this area where electricity has become almost human rights. Many \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n \\n\\npeople do not have access, so under the social economic umbrella, 15,000 people were given \\n\\nsolar, and now their houses are lightened by the unit. And agriculture equipment is given to \\n\\nvarious universities that are doing research, and they're upgrading their skills. \\n\\nDuring COVID 19, China has given under the social economic umbrella 8 billion R&B, which is \\n\\nutilised for various projects and is now also used for upgrading social economic development, so \\n\\nthese are areas that are transforming lives and livelihoods. These areas need to be focused on \\n\\nmore, and these areas are more \\n\\nrelated to the subject matter of this \\n\\nseminar. CPEC is working slowly \\n\\nunder constraints; it may be a \\n\\nbalance of payment constraint or a \\n\\nlower economic growth constraint, \\n\\nbut surely the system is working. \\n\\nSecond phase we will be thinking \\n\\nmore about the people's decisions \\n\\nbecause in the first phase, \\n\\ninfrastructure was focused so people's lives were not impacted, but in the second field, although \\n\\nthe transactions might not be on that level, they will transform much faster than in the first phase, \\n\\nand this is critical for the people at that time as well \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 First phase of CPEC focused on addressing infrastructure and energy gaps in Pakistan, which \\n\\nwere essential for laying the foundation for economic growth.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 International cooperation, particularly through CPEC, is seen as crucial in stabilizing the \\n\\neconomy and attracting industries to SEZs, which are key to long-term growth. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The second phase of CPEC emphasizes utilizing existing infrastructure to boost economic \\n\\ngrowth. This includes a stronger focus on agriculture and livestock, areas previously \\n\\noverlooked, to create jobs and address rural challenges.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Initiatives like providing solar panels to 15,000 households and upgrading agricultural \\n\\nresearch have improved lives in rural areas.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n26 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Muzammil Zia, Regional Connectivity & Infrastructure Specialist,  \\n\\nCPEC Secretariat \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cOverview of Commissioned Infrastructure Projects of CPEC and their Impact on \\n\\nShared Future of Mankind\\u201d \\n\\nWe gather here to reflect on the achievements of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nand to chart the course of its future phase under the \\n\\nvisionary framework of the Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative (BRI). Today we are in the month of July \\n\\n2024. If you go back 11 years in this month, on \\n\\nJuly 5, 2013, the first MOU was signed between \\n\\nthe two countries. On July 5th, a three-page \\n\\ndocument was signed in Beijing, and no one knew \\n\\nabout the Belt and Road Initiative at the time, and \\n\\nno one knew about the CPEC or what it would \\n\\nlook like. But with the great effort of both sides leadership in the past 11 years, through the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a huge success has been achieved in Pakistan. 11 \\n\\nyears before no one knows that what would what was going to happen after one decade. In one \\n\\ndecade, through the Belt and Road Initiative, more than 1 billion dollars of investments have \\n\\nbeen made by China throughout the world in more than 3,000 projects. And out of those, \\n\\nPakistan succeeded in completing more than 26 billion projects. \\n\\nIn Pakistan, out of which 16 projects worth 166 billion dollars of energy projects have been \\n\\ncompleted, approximately eight projects worth 6 billion dollars have been completed, which \\n\\ninclude the KKH motorway, the Orange Line train, and others.Then, around five projects in \\n\\nGwadar Port as well as in the Free Zone worth 0.5 million have been completed in one decade. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n27 \\n \\n\\nFor social and economic development, approximately nine projects worth 0.5 million have been \\n\\ncompleted in this time frame, so last year, to celebrate the decade of CPEC, especially the vice \\n\\npremium  we hold the conference  the decade of CPEC conference where all the dignitaries have \\n\\nparticipated and everyone shed light on the progress China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nhave achieved so most of you people have a very clear idea that in the phase one what we have \\n\\nachieved and but now it's time for the phase two of CPEC the recent visit of prime minister of \\n\\nPakistan to China the we had a like a business Forum in China where more than 20 MOUs have \\n\\nbeen signed between the Pakistani Enterprises and the Chinese Enterprises those show interest of \\n\\nChinese investor to invest in Pakistan. \\n\\nSo the first focus in the first decade was only on the energy and infrastructure needs so today I \\n\\nwe can easily say that we already have enough energy in our system and we have enough good \\n\\nconnectivity of Gwadar port and road \\n\\nthat we can we are ready to move from \\n\\nfirst phase to second phase. In the \\n\\nsecond phase, the top priority is \\n\\nindustrialisation. Both governments \\n\\nhave already identified nine special \\n\\neconomic zones throughout Pakistan, \\n\\nand out of those nine special economic \\n\\nzones, four are the most prioritised, \\n\\nlocated in each province. \\n\\nFor example like in we have the Rashakai special economic in KPK, Allama Iqbal Industrial City \\n\\nzones in Punjab we have economic zone  we have Dhabi special economic zone in Sindh and in \\n\\nbaluchistan we have Bostan Industrial Zone economic zone. So these four SEZs are prioritised \\n\\nSEZs, and we, the current government, are really working hard to provide all the basic \\n\\nnecessities in those SEZs to attract maximum Chinese investment as we are moving forward with \\n\\nfive new corridors in phase two of CPEC, and those five corridors are named growth corridor \\n\\ngreen corridor, livelihood corridor, innovation corridor, and openness corridor. So these five \\n\\ncorridors will be the guiding principles for the second phase, and for example, for the growth \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n \\n\\ncorridor in the next phase, the more focus will be on the growth strategies and how to improve \\n\\nPakistan's growth. \\n\\nNow the government's current strategy is to improve their imports and exports towards China, \\n\\nand that includes the agriculture product project. In the last year, many protocols have been \\n\\nsigned, including the cherry from this year that Pakistan made in Pakistan, growing Pakistan. \\n\\nCherry is important, and we are also trying to negotiate for the fresh meat export to China, so the \\n\\nopportunities are big, and we all have to work really hard to achieve them all to attain the \\n\\nmaximum out of these opportunities. To keep in view these opportunities, the CPEC ambitions \\n\\nand scope have been enhanced. In the beginning, we had only four areas of cooperation, but now \\n\\nwe have 11 areas of cooperation.  \\n\\nThese new areas include science and technology. Information technology and social economic \\n\\ndevelopment agriculture, international cooperation, and industry cooperation, so these new areas \\n\\nwill provide new input to the CPEC Phase 2, and we are very hopeful that through the CPEC \\n\\nPhase 2, we will be able to achieve more progress in terms of country exports and their impact \\n\\non the livelihood of the local people because phase one was focused more on infrastructure \\n\\nthings and through phase one as well. Pakistan created more than 250,000 direct jobs and a much \\n\\nbigger number of indirect jobs in Pakistan through the first phase, but for the second phase, the \\n\\nnumber is huge if we are able to achieve those targets, especially in the industrial and  special \\n\\neconomic zones. \\n\\n Key Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Over the past 11 years, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has achieved \\n\\nsubstantial progress, with investments exceeding $26 billion in Pakistan alone.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 With the completion of essential energy and infrastructure projects in the first phase, CPEC \\n\\nis now entering its second phase. The focus is shifting towards industrialization, with nine \\n\\nSpecial Economic Zones (SEZs) identified across Pakistan.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The scope of CPEC has expanded from four to eleven areas of cooperation in Phase Two. \\n\\nNew areas include science and technology, information technology, social and economic \\n\\ndevelopment, agriculture, and international cooperation.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n29 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The second phase of CPEC introduces five new corridors designed to guide Pakistan\\u2019s \\n\\nsustainable development.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The government's strategy includes enhancing exports, such as fresh agricultural products to \\n\\nChina, which will positively impact local livelihoods and contribute to economic stability. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. David Haruna Mrisho, Head of Department of Public Relations and \\n\\nMarketing, University of St. Augustine, Tanzania & Director East African Research \\n\\nCenter for a Community with Shared Future \\n\\nI wish to thank the organizers of this very beautiful event, and in a very specialwhereby we sit \\n\\ndown and discuss issues pertaining to the building of a \\n\\nworld that finds peace, harmony, and prosperity \\n\\ntogether, having discussions on how the community of \\n\\na shared future is a necessity towards building a better \\n\\nworld. My reflection and talk today centers on the \\n\\nStrategic significance of community of future what it \\n\\nmatters and what it means for Africa and maybe in this \\n\\nvery in a very specific way my country Tanzania. \\n\\nWhen I was trying to think about why humans need a philosophy or a path towards a better \\n\\nworld, the history of humanity came into my mind. Humans in history have witnessed not so \\n\\nmuch of a good history. Human history, for the most part, is the history of wars; it is the history \\n\\nof mysteries; it is a history of economic instability; we have the history of poverty; the history of \\n\\nsocial and political turmoil; neverless, humans in a search for the best possible arrangement that \\n\\ncan save as a panacea for the problems of humanity. \\n\\nWe witnessed today civil wars in Europe we witness today. We still witness today some red \\n\\nmeans of imperialism and even more some ideas of imperial conquest, and we witness today \\n\\nmuch of the human trade of dehumanisation and a sheer exuberance of selfishness by powerful \\n\\nempires and Leaders in this world even when, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, we never \\n\\ncreated an International System of Justice. We never created democratic global governance, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n \\n\\nfreedom, and equity, but rather a more dictatorial global system with the United States emerging \\n\\nat the so-called International Policedictating what they should do and what they should not do, \\n\\nsuch creation further divided the world, identifying some states as allies and some as partners \\n\\nand friends.  \\n\\nToday, we have hope, and we see a better future because of a new concept called the concept of \\n\\nbuilding a community of a shared future. This concept has become a better gift to humanity, an \\n\\nalternative to altering the cause of historical global turbulence and providing a framework for the \\n\\nworld to be a better place and for humanity to be rescued. \\n\\nI, along with so many of us, thank the head of state of the People's Republic of China,  President \\n\\nXi Jinping, an intellectually and philosophically modern leader who fits the platonian description \\n\\nand prescription of leaders that can transform and change the world. He has initiated initiatives \\n\\nthat are not only beneficial for Chinese people but to the entire human race. He introduced the \\n\\nconcept of building a shared future back in 2013 and aimed at fostering a new type of \\n\\ninternational relations based on mutual respect, fairness, justice, and win-win cooperation. The \\n\\nconcept emphasises the importance of building a harmonious and prosperous world through \\n\\ndialogue, consultation, and cooperation among nations regardless of their size, strength, or stage \\n\\nof development, my dear colleagues. This concept is a vision of a world where all countries can \\n\\ndevelop and prosper together, a world where there is peace, stability, and common development. \\n\\nThe concept is based on the principles of mutual respect and equality. \\n\\nMutual benefit and peaceful existence are good, constructive paths. This is a good rationale \\n\\nbehind building a community of mankind in which the community is open to each other. The \\n\\ncommunity thinks about inclusivity\\u2014a community that is clean and beautiful with lasting peace, \\n\\nuniversal security, and shared prosperity. The strategic guide of this concept is implementing the \\n\\nglobal development initiative, the global security initiative, and the global civilisation initiative, \\n\\nand therefore becoming a platform for action towards which the world becomes a better place. \\n\\nThe community of a shared future is one that allows developing countries to work together to \\n\\nmake the pie of the global economy bigger and share it with fairness so as to make development \\n\\nboth adequate and balanced and help people of all natures in all countries of all walks of life \\n\\nembark on a journey to modernisation. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n31 \\n \\n\\nThe model community of a shared future provides Africa with the opportunities to navigate this \\n\\ntraditional cycle of production to learn and share experiences with China for a prosperous \\n\\ncontinent that will fit in this great community. Africa should learn from China through some \\n\\ntechnological breakthroughs through research and development, and replication should refine \\n\\nAfricans to fit in this community. Export growth should be consolidated for African countries \\n\\nthrough massive \\n\\nindustrialisation with partnership and cooperation with China. The realization of the above goals \\n\\nhas to go with political feasibility and Readiness to transform and fit in this community with a \\n\\nshared future but this cannot be enhanced without considering who are there to belong for the \\n\\nfuture the Young Generation and this is the reason why the East African Research Center exist \\n\\nnot only to discuss and share the prosperity and the beauty of such a community but to teach the \\n\\nYoung generation why and how this philosophy is important we were established way back 2020 \\n\\nwith other close to 18 centers globally. Our intention is turning to the young people to the \\n\\nstudents and instilling them why development is important why peace is important. \\n\\nTanzania should believe in its own capacity to develop without coping with the world. We do \\n\\npresentations and workshops, but we are trying to teach our students the need for dialogue, \\n\\nstarting with workshops and conferences on religious dialogue.

We \\n\\ngathered here to reflect on \\n\\nthe achievements of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic \\n\\nCorridor (CPEC) and to \\n\\ncharge the course for its \\n\\nfuture phases under the \\n\\nvisionary framework of the \\n\\nBelt and Road Initiative \\n\\n(BRI). The journey of the \\n\\nCPEC began in 2013. Over the past decades, we have witnessed remarkable milestones that have \\n\\ntransformed the economic landscape of Pakistan. CPEC phase one focused primarily on \\n\\naddressing the immediate needs of our nation by incorporating energy into the national grid, \\n\\nconstructing vital infrastructure projects, including motorways and highways, and developing \\n\\nand operationalizing the strategic Gwadar port. These achievements have laid a solid foundation \\n\\nfor the next phase of CPEC. As we move forward, both the Ministry of Planning in Pakistan and \\n\\nthe National Development and Reform Commission of China have launched CPEC Phase 2. This \\n\\nnew phase signifies a broader and more ambitious scope, focusing on industrial relocation, \\n\\nagricultural moderation, job creation, and the socioeconomic well-being of our people. Under \\n\\nCPEC Phase 2, five new corridors have been proposed by President Xi Jinping: the number one \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n33 \\n \\n\\ngrowth corridor, the number two livelihood-enhancing corridor, and the number three innovation \\n\\ncorridor. The fourth is the green corridor, and the fifth is the opening-up and digital connectivity \\n\\ncorridor. \\n\\nWe are preparing separate concept papers on these new economic corridors, which will provide a \\n\\nclear road map for each of these sectors. These concept papers will be consolidated for \\n\\npresentation at the upcoming joint coordination committee JCC meeting. This strategic approach \\n\\nensures that every sector is aligned with our Union for a prosperous and interconnected Pakistan. \\n\\nThe high-quality development and vision for CPEC Phase 2 is much broader in scope, which will \\n\\nnot only bring advanced manufacturing technologies to Pakistan but also create numerous jobs \\n\\nand opportunities for our youth in agricultural modernisation are another key focus area aimed at \\n\\nenhancing our food security and improving the livelihoods of our farmers through the adoption \\n\\nof cutting-edge technologies, science, and technology. \\n\\nCooperation will play a vital role in driving innovation and fostering a knowledge-based \\n\\neconomy. We are committed to creating a conducive environment for research and development, \\n\\nenabling our scientists and researchers to collaborate with their Chinese counterparts and make \\n\\ngroundbreaking advancements. In addition, we are making rapid progress on the development of \\n\\nthe Gwadar Port as well as the free trade zone. This will promote regional connectivity and \\n\\neconomic integration, positioning Pakistan as a hub for trade and commerce. The potential for \\n\\ntransporter trade with neighbouring countries like Iran, Afghanistan, and the Central Asian States \\n\\nis immense. We have already seen positive impacts with trade consignments destined for \\n\\nAfghanistan being cleared from Gwadar Port under the leadership of Pakistan. We have \\n\\ntransformed our policy from geopolitics to geoeconomics. This region aims to create a well-\\n\\nconnected, integrated region of shared destiny, harmony, and development. The ministry of \\n\\nplanning, development, and special initiatives has already initiated the implementation of the 5S \\n\\nframework, which includes exports, energy, equity, e-Pakistan, and the environment. This \\n\\nframework aligns with the five New Economic Corridors under CPEC Phase 2 to advance \\n\\nPakistan's prosperity in each sector under the vision of our leadership by emphasising export \\n\\ncapabilities through enterprise development and job creation. We aim to accelerate our economic \\n\\ngrowth and uplift the living standards of our people. In conclusion, the CPEC is not just a \\n\\nbilateral project benefiting Pakistan and China. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n34 \\n \\n\\n It also has far-reaching positive impacts on the entire region. By promoting regional \\n\\nconnectivity and transport trade, we are building a future where prosperity is shared, and \\n\\ndevelopment is inclusive. The CPEC will continue to play a role in achieving this vision and \\n\\nfostering a community with a shared future for mankind. I look forward to very fruitful \\n\\ndiscussions and collaborations during this conference. Long live the Park-China friendship. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 CPEC Phase 2 signifies a broader and more ambitious scope, focusing on industrial \\n\\nrelocation, agricultural moderation, job creation, and the socioeconomic well-being of our \\n\\npeople. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The high-quality development and vision for CPEC Phase 2 is much broader in scope, which \\n\\nwill not only bring advanced manufacturing technologies to Pakistan but also create \\n\\nnumerous jobs and opportunities for our youth in agricultural modernization \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The CPEC will continue to play a role in achieving this vision and fostering a community \\n\\nwith a shared future for mankind. I look forward to very fruitful discussions and \\n\\ncollaborations during this conference. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n35 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Liaqat Ali Shah, Executive Director, Center of Excellence for CPEC, PIDE \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cBuilding the  Community of Shared Future for the betterment of Mankind\\u201d \\n\\nShared future for humankind or for mankind, this concept was coined back in 2012 but expressed \\n\\nat a university in Moscow by President Xi \\n\\nJinping, and later on, the diplomatic occupation \\n\\nconcept linked Chinese characteristics with \\n\\nsocialism. In the 19th National Party Congress of \\n\\n2017, the Chinese Communist Party of China \\n\\nagreed unanimously that it basically provided a \\n\\nguiding principle for development. It's not about \\n\\ndevelopment in China; it's about Chinese \\n\\ninteraction with the rest of the world. \\n\\nThis is the underpinning of this concept framework, or the concept of the community for \\n\\nhumankind, so I will approach this topic from a different standpoint and explain these things, but \\n\\nfrom a different perspective. So basically, the community of shared culture with humankind was \\n\\nmade up of the five principles of coexistence, which your Excellency talked about in detail. The \\n\\nfirst principle is the community of shared future with political sovereignty, and this concept is \\n\\nvery important to understand, even in international organisations. We often heard the word \\n\\nsovereignty in every country. Basically, we think every country should respect other countries \\n\\nsovereignty, but the Chinese actually take on that concept and expand on it. \\n\\nI think the size, strength, and wealth of every other country should be respected. You know the \\n\\nsovereignity of other countries and respect the dignity of that country. We speak today, there are \\n\\nsome countries who think about you know the hegemony and you know of some Western \\n\\ncountries especially United States we have often experienced we often observed they violated it \\n\\nfor their own interest but Chinese think otherwise and that's why the political community is the \\n\\ncommunity of shared future with political sovereignty. That's basically the guiding principle also \\n\\nfor the Chinese diplomatic community and the rest of the world. The second principle in this \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n36 \\n \\n\\nconcept is that the second aspect of this concept is community of shared future with security. \\n\\nWhen we talk about security, there are two aspects: one is traditional security and the second is \\n\\nnon-traditional security and traditional security. Normally, wars and conflicts happen, and we \\n\\ncan't avoid them because you know there are some differences in certain networks, which \\n\\nbasically lead to conflicts. \\n\\nUkraine Russia-Ukraine war and other in you know other part of the world, but nontraditional \\n\\nsecurity is also very important. I think this is a common challenge to all humanity, and that is, \\n\\nyou know, food security, energy security, and ecological security, which is also you, we think we \\n\\ntalk about the climate changes. \\n\\nAll these securities are very important, and if we ignore one US security or we basically \\n\\nunderestimate the importance of one security to others, I think the global governance system and \\n\\nthe global order will not be the same.So I think we need to approach all these difficulties. you \\n\\nknow and we should coordinate some response and act is a coherent body to tackle these \\n\\nchallenges so that's basically what this concept entails and this concept talks about the third \\n\\naspect of this principle is the community of shared future with economic interconnectedness and \\n\\nthat's really very important. \\n\\nThat's basically all ground connectivity there infrastructure connectivity, trade, investment \\n\\nconnectivity policy coordination of connectivity NBI People to People exchanges so these are \\n\\nthe different activity all of them they are important and I think in CPEC if we speak today I think \\n\\none missing link is policy coordination and the second thing is the People to People exchanges \\n\\nbetween Pakistan and China even though we there are some exchanges but I think the extent of \\n\\nthe exchange it should be more it should be multiplied and I think once people connect with each \\n\\nother mean we in the government possibly in connect with China so we have a hierarchical \\n\\nrelationship with ChinaThere will be some collaboration, so these are really important, and this \\n\\naspect and this connectivity. In this very concept we are talking about today, the fourth aspect of \\n\\nthis concept is the community of civilization.  \\n\\nChinese they understand you know we heard about you modernisation mean what is \\n\\nmodernization if a woman in Pakistan or any other country with Abaya for example  you know \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n37 \\n \\n\\neven though she's educated would not be considered a modern because he doesn't fit into the \\n\\nWestern values so modernization is a tend to westernism. Every region has its own civilisation, \\n\\nand it should be respected as well, so instead of forcing everybody to fit into Western values, the \\n\\nbetter would be to respect their civilisation, respect their values, respect their social system, and \\n\\nthen create harmony. \\n\\nSo this harmony and this President Xi Jinping idea of a shared future, I think, are the way for the \\n\\nworld because you may have heard about, read about, or heard about the clash of civilisations \\n\\nwhere it talks about, you know, Samuel Huntington. I don't know exactly the name of the author, \\n\\nbut I think it is Phillips Huntington. He says that in the future, conflicts would not basically be on \\n\\neconomic, you know, resources; they would be on cultural differences, and disputes would all \\n\\nbasically be on differences, you know, in different cultures, so for a peaceful and lasting peace in \\n\\nthe world, harmony among civilisations is very important. \\n\\nChina you know the and the development of the renewable energy every form of renewable \\n\\nenergy I think China is basically leading in bent Hydro green hydrogen solar and so many other \\n\\nnew energy forms and why should we pollute and then reduce the emission. Now the renewable \\n\\nenergy have made viable fossil fuel is has no future in the future and for that reason I think we \\n\\nshould adopt and we should embrace the green development and I think Chinese basically with \\n\\ntheir wisdom and with their technology are providing all the means to the rest of the world.  \\n\\nIf we look at the picture with five different aspects and bring it together, bring all these pieces \\n\\ntogether. I think this is a very beautiful concept to reform the global governance system to bring \\n\\npeace and security, enjoy lasting peace, and share the benefits of development across the board. \\n\\nDefinitely, there will be some areas of interest, but through dialogue and discussion, we can \\n\\nmanage it and have a future together. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The concept of a \\\"Community of Shared Future for Mankind\\\" serves as a guiding principle \\n\\nfor international development and diplomacy. It emphasizes mutual respect for sovereignty, \\n\\npolitical cooperation, and the importance of non-hegemonic relations between nations, \\n\\nparticularly in contrast to Western dominance. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n38 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is need for enhanced economic interconnectedness through infrastructure, trade, and \\n\\npolicy coordination, especially within initiatives like CPEC. Additionally, it stresses the \\n\\nimportance of respecting cultural diversity and avoiding the imposition of Western values as \\n\\na universal standard of modernization. Harmony among civilizations is viewed as crucial for \\n\\nlasting global peace. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China is leading the way in renewable energy technologies and urges global adoption of \\n\\nthese practices to ensure sustainable development. Green energy is presented as the future, \\n\\nwith fossil fuels becoming obsolete, making it imperative for nations to embrace eco-friendly \\n\\ngrowth strategies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n39 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Waqas Anwar, Member of Infrastructure and Regional Connectivity, \\n\\nPlanning Commission \\n\\n       Topic: \\u201cTransport Infrastructure as Key to Connectivity\\u201d \\n\\nThe Vision 2025 National Transport Policy is our blueprint for achieving this goal, laying the \\n\\nfoundation for a future where all regions of our country are connected, fostering trade, \\n\\ninvestment, and growth. \\n\\nOur priorities under the Vision 2025 National Transport Policy are clear: we must accelerate and \\n\\nimplement a comprehensive program of \\n\\ntransport sector reform. This includes fast-\\n\\ntracking and continuing ongoing sector-\\n\\nspecific reforms, improving the maintenance \\n\\nand safety of our road networks, and adopting \\n\\nnew contracting mechanisms that prioritize \\n\\nsafety at every step. Safety is not just an \\n\\nafterthought; it is integral to every phase of \\n\\nour transport infrastructure projects. From the \\n\\ndesign phase to execution, safety measures will be embedded to protect our citizens and ensure \\n\\nthe long-term sustainability of our transport assets. \\n\\nA critical aspect of our strategy is maximizing the utilization of our railway network. The \\n\\nupgrades to ML-1 and ML-2, as well as improved connections to key economic hubs, are \\n\\nessential for enhancing the \\n\\nefficiency and capacity of our \\n\\nrailways. These upgrades will \\n\\nfacilitate faster and more reliable \\n\\ntransport of goods and passengers, \\n\\nwhich in turn will support economic \\n\\nactivities across the country. Our \\n\\ninvestment in urban transport \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n40 \\n \\n\\ninfrastructure will also see the development of comprehensive Urban Transport Master Plans for \\n\\nall large cities, prioritizing public transport and making our urban centers more livable and \\n\\neconomically vibrant. \\n\\nRegional and international connectivity are central to our vision. The China-Pakistan Economic \\n\\nCorridor (CPEC) and the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) routes present \\n\\nunparalleled opportunities for Pakistan to integrate more deeply into the regional and global \\n\\neconomy. By leveraging these routes, we can become a hub for trade and commerce, attracting \\n\\ninvestment and creating jobs that will uplift communities across the nation. \\n\\nThe National Transport Master Plan serves as the overarching framework that interfaces with \\n\\nseveral key policies, including the National Freight and Logistics Policy, the National Aviation \\n\\nPolicy, and the National Electric Vehicle Policy, among others. This comprehensive approach \\n\\nensures that all aspects of transport and logistics are aligned with our broader national \\n\\ndevelopment goals. For example, our Road Transport Plan is largely complete, with a focus now \\n\\nshifting to maintenance and service delivery. This includes trialing and rolling out a new \\n\\napproach to Road Asset Management, which will see the restructuring of the National Highway \\n\\nAuthority (NHA) along commercial lines. \\n\\nThe introduction of a comprehensive vehicle fleet renewal program, aligned with international \\n\\nstandards, and the promotion of electric vehicles are crucial steps in modernizing our transport \\n\\nsector. These initiatives not only contribute to reducing emissions but also ensure that our \\n\\ntransport infrastructure is sustainable and resilient in the face of future challenges. \\n\\nIn the railway sector, comprehensive institutional reform of Pakistan Railways is underway. We \\n\\nare establishing a new Railway Policy Board to bring a more structured focus on services, \\n\\nseparating policy formulation, budgetary control, regulation, and management functions. \\n\\nInvestments in upgrading ML-1 and ML-2, as well as improving access to Karachi Port and \\n\\nselected dry ports, Special Economic Zones (SEZs), and other economic centers, will be vital in \\n\\nenhancing the efficiency of our rail network. \\n\\nOur vision for multimodal transport includes the establishment of a Freight and Logistics \\n\\nRegulatory Authority, the development of freight villages at dry ports and SEZs, and the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n41 \\n \\n\\nprioritization of the National Single Window for trade facilitation. By 2035, we envision that 30 \\n\\ncities across Pakistan will have developed comprehensive urban transport master plans, with \\n\\n95% of the urban population having convenient access to public transport. These investments, \\n\\ntotaling over PKR 1,080 billion from federal public budgets, will not only improve connectivity \\n\\nbut also significantly reduce transport emissions in our largest cities. \\n\\nOur pipeline infrastructure is another key focus area. Establishing and implementing a structured \\n\\nnetwork plan of new pipeline connections that link port terminals, refineries, storage depots, and \\n\\nother key economic sites will enhance the efficiency of our energy and industrial sectors. The \\n\\nconstruction of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India pipeline and the development of \\n\\nnew LNG facilities will further bolster our energy security and economic growth. \\n\\nLastly, we recognize the potential of inland waterway transport, particularly given Pakistan\\u2019s \\n\\nextensive canal system and the Indus River. A feasibility study will be conducted to assess the \\n\\nviability of utilizing the Indus River for the transportation of freight, which could offer a \\n\\nvaluable addition to our transport network. The reforms and investments outlined in our Vision \\n\\n2025 National Transport Policy will not only connect our people and regions but also propel \\n\\nPakistan towards greater economic prosperity and social development. Together, we can build a \\n\\nfuture where connectivity serves as the backbone of a thriving and resilient nation. \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The introduction of a comprehensive vehicle fleet renewal program, aligned with \\n\\ninternational standards, and the promotion of electric vehicles are crucial steps in \\n\\nmodernizing our transport sector.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We are establishing a new Railway Policy Board to bring a more structured focus on \\n\\nservices, separating policy formulation, budgetary control, regulation, and management \\n\\nfunctions. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The reforms and investments outlined in our Vision 2025 National Transport Policy will not \\n\\nonly connect our people and regions but also propel Pakistan towards greater economic \\n\\nprosperity and social development. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n42 \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Prof. Dr. Sajid Rashid Ahmad, Dean, Faculty of Geosciences, University of the \\n\\nPunjab, Lahore \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cPresident Xi Jinping\\u2019s vision for environment friendly shared community under \\n\\nthe framework of Belt & Road Initiative\\u201d \\n\\nToday's top topic is President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road initiative. The goal of the global \\n\\ndevelopment strategy, which our several \\n\\nspeakers already told us about the CPEC, \\n\\nand the first phase and the second phase \\n\\nare now going on, our prime minister said, \\n\\nand now it will be started soon. But the \\n\\nmain thing is that the vision of the \\n\\npresidency in 2013 is to improve regional \\n\\nconnectivity and collaboration between \\n\\nAsia, Europe, and Africa. And there are \\n\\ntwo primary initiatives of his vision: one is the Silk Road Economic Belt, and number two is the \\n\\n21\\nst\\n century maritime Silk Road. The main thing is whether it is environment-friendly or not. \\n\\nYes, it is an environment-friendly project. This is the ancient Sill Road in China. \\n\\nThe development of an ecological civilisation and an inclusive and peaceful community are key \\n\\ncomponents of the presidency's sustainability in order to create a brighter future for everybody. \\n\\nThis strategy seeks to accomplish this sustainable development while safeguarding the \\n\\nenvironment. Advanced social harmony strengthens international collaboration. These values, \\n\\nwhich represent a dedication to creating long-term prosperity, stability, and wellbeing for its \\n\\ncitizens and the global community, serve as the foundation of China's domestic programme and \\n\\nforeign policy initiatives. So this is the region, and these are some of the policy guidelines we \\n\\nshould pursue for the new vision of green development and a way of life and work that is green, \\n\\nlow carbon, c circular, and sustainable. Efforts should be made to strengthen the population in \\n\\necological and environmental protection and build a sound ecosystem. We will set up a big data \\n\\nservice platform on ecological and environmental protection, and that setup means that if 150 \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n43 \\n \\n\\ncountries set up their own data and shared that data, that is the big data service platform. We \\n\\npropose the establishment of an international coalition of green development on the Belt and \\n\\nRoad Initiative, and we will provide support to related countries in adapting to climate change. \\n\\n Pakistan and others will, so these are some of the principles of environmentally friendly \\n\\ndevelopment in BRI sustainable infrastructure green investment. We are all talking about \\n\\npollution prevention and control and biodiversity conservation. Water Resource Management \\n\\nenvironmental impact assessments climate change mitigationand adaptation  International \\n\\nstandards and best practices environmental governance, community engagement, social \\n\\nresponsibility monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building By adhering to these principles, \\n\\nthe BRI aims to promote sustainable development, minimise environmental impacts, and create a \\n\\nharmonious relationship between development and the natural environment. \\n\\nThe Chinese approach to green infrastructure refers to the initiative that supports the creation of \\n\\nsustainable and resilient \\n\\ninfrastructure development. This \\n\\nentails incorporating sustainable \\n\\nmaterials. Energy design \\n\\nincorporates green technology into \\n\\nthe planning and execution of the \\n\\nproject's environmental standards. \\n\\nmaintain strict environmental \\n\\nstandards. investment in renewable \\n\\nenergy, endorsing investment along belt and road corridors in renewable energy sources such as \\n\\nhydroelectric, solar, and wind power. ecological conservation to mitigate the effects of the \\n\\nenvironment and Foster ecological resilience efforts should be made to conserve biodiversity, \\n\\nrestore habitats, and protect the ecosystem, and then collaboration and capacity building are the \\n\\nmajor problems in Pakistan. We should focus on these things: collaboration and capacity \\n\\nbuilding. \\n\\nPresident Xi\\u2019s vision is sustainability, followed by financial support and international \\n\\ncooperation working together to strengthen cooperation on environmental protection, the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n44 \\n \\n\\ndeployment of clean energy, and technology transfer. This is not the China-Pakistan economic \\n\\ncorridor; this is the China-Pakistan environmental corridor, because in this way we can improve \\n\\nthe environment of our country and also over areas like the Karot hydropower projects and the \\n\\nGwadar. Here is the CPEC project, so these are the three Corridors: the Central route, the Eastern \\n\\nroute, and the Western route. So up to now, it's 2024. As the previous speaker already \\n\\nmentioned, how much work has been covered now that it's phase two? So the project under \\n\\nCPEC infrastructure development is an industrial economic zone and telecommunications \\n\\nproject, and the main thing is the key collaborative efforts of the government-to-government \\n\\ncollaboration with international partner public-private partnership research institutions. \\n\\nAt the government level, or this CPEC level, any academia is here, and they are giving their \\n\\nresearch collaboration their research outputs because, at the University of the Punjab, we already \\n\\nhave MOUs with 25 universities in China and are already working with them. We already have \\n\\nprojects on mineral exploration and environmental, climate change, solar, and electrical \\n\\nengineering. They have the collaboration, but there is no platform where we have to give this \\n\\nresearch knowledge the same pram as community engagement, environmental organisation, and \\n\\ntechnology. \\n\\nWe just talk about the human being, but his vision is also about the ecosystem, the animals, and \\n\\nthe human beings. Everything is okay, so learn and follow best practices. We already mentioned \\n\\nmonitoring, evaluation, knowledge sharing, and capacity building. Green Technology policy \\n\\nalignment regulation. Community social development program, infrastructure expansion, and \\n\\naccomplishing the strategy goals. \\n\\nIn conclusion, a big commitment to global sustainable development is seen. The second thing is \\n\\nthat China should encourage international cooperation for a cleaner, greener future by giving \\n\\nenvironmental reservation, resource conservation, and green growth the top priority. The idea is \\n\\nnot only the problem with the environment today but also a standard of global cooperation and \\n\\ncollaboration in sustainable development and under the BRI. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n45 \\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Chinese approach to green infrastructure refers to the initiative that supports the creation \\n\\nof sustainable and resilient infrastructure development. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 At the government level, or this CPEC level, any academia is here, and they are giving their \\n\\nresearch collaboration their research outputs because, at the University of the Punjab, we \\n\\nalready have MOUs with 25 universities in China and are already working with them. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China should encourage international cooperation for a cleaner, greener future by giving \\n\\nenvironmental reservation, resource conservation, and green growth the top priority. The idea \\n\\nis not only the problem with the environment today but also a standard of global cooperation \\n\\nand collaboration in sustainable development and under the BRI. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMs. Maria Francesca Stainno Latin America Research Center for a Community with \\n\\nShared Future and Belt & Road Initiative, and Associate Professor at National University \\n\\nof La Plata, Buenos Aires, Argentina \\n\\nTopic: Building a Community with a Shared Future for Mankind and its Convergence with \\n\\nLatin American International Relations \\n\\nI will talk about building a community with a sure future for \\n\\nmankind and its convergence with Latin American \\n\\ninternational relations, especially from a theoretical \\n\\nperspective. \\n\\nWe are witnessing a decline of Western theories with a \\n\\ncorresponding rise of non-Western theories.\\u2016 We also \\n\\nneeded detachment from the positivist scientific method \\n\\nthrough methodological purism, especially in the field of \\n\\nsocial sciences, where the human being is the object of investigation, not only the subject, and \\n\\nthe sciences cannot interpret it. We need an integrated human spirit in the social sciences, so we \\n\\nalso need a language change. Multidimensionality and multidisciplinarity are present, so this is \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n46 \\n \\n\\nwhy I put in contact Chinese and Latin American international relations theories. Furthermore, \\n\\nwe also need new paradigms against the so-called mainstream, so the main definition comes \\n\\nfrom the Chinese perspective and experience in international relations. I consider it a community \\n\\nwith a shared future for mankind, and I also interpreted it from a Chinese perspective, using at \\n\\nleast three methodological categories that are connected with the three main schools of \\n\\ninternational relations in China. That's why I interpreted the definition of community with a \\n\\nshared future for mankind with the key expressions of relationality, human authority, and \\n\\nsymbiosis. With this explanation, the community refers to the set of states small and large that \\n\\npeacefullycoexist among them: self-relationality through our common values inspired by leading \\n\\ncountries as responsible for international order. This is the human authority perspective of \\n\\nrespecting and helping each other. This is the school of symbiosis. The idea of linking autonomy \\n\\nwith solidarity between Latin American countries according to a strategic perspective is in line \\n\\nwith the Chinese description of symbiosis and human authority as well as relationality, so the \\n\\nschool of the theory of autonomy in Latin America is very comparable with the idea of building \\n\\na community with a shared future for mankind, in fact solidarity integration, where the \\n\\nconstitution of a Latin American region implies the need for a relationality between these \\n\\ncountries that recognises the authority of one or more leaders. \\n\\n The importance of the country is not of Argentina. The Brazil axis is constitutive of the \\n\\npossibility of the inter-integration of the Latin American region in a symbiotic process that \\n\\ngenerates a series of alliances towards the construction of a new order that ensures international \\n\\nsocial justice, a concept that is very comparable to that of a community with a sure future for \\n\\nmankind.So what are the keys to strengthening this community with a shared future between \\n\\nChina and Latin America, of \\n\\ncourse, as seen in the \\n\\ncooperation approach? \\n\\nespecially in the many human \\n\\nrights topics such as poverty, \\n\\nelevation, sustainable \\n\\ndevelopment, and \\n\\ndigitalisation, with a long-\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n47 \\n \\n\\nterm approach that is very often used in Latin America. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we can't have national and subnational cooperation. According to a the \\n\\nconstruction and reconstruction of the main human right concept like development people Center \\n\\napproach with new meanings in line with South experience and civilizations also building an \\n\\nalternative and evolutionary approach to the corporation like for example with Latin America-\\n\\nChina Dialogues Forum last week for example I was participate in the fourth China Forum on \\n\\npoverty and development and also we have to create our Latin American characteristics as well \\n\\nas white papers like good practices to adopt to have a more intensive dialogue with China under \\n\\na regional perspective so some converges uh both China and Latin America belong to a global \\n\\nSouth that is merging with new voice in contemporary international relations in a science . \\n\\nSo some final remarks the Chinese concept of community with a sure future for kind as \\n\\ninterpreted in the international law relations is the search for not only an alternative but also an \\n\\nevolutionary system of international relations capable of replace the demonic International \\n\\nSystem with new creative solutions and it can be only overcome throughout the construction of \\n\\ncommon actions with International cooperation based no longer to on an hostile vision between \\n\\nctates but on a communion of intention of the peoples this is the real formal Innovation brought \\n\\nabout by the community with a share future for mankind and that is why it means a \\n\\ndemocratization in international relations according to a common shared values and practices.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is need for a departure from positivist scientific methods in favor of more integrated \\n\\nand multidimensional approaches in social sciences, especially regarding the human element \\n\\nin international relations. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Latin American theories of autonomy and solidarity align with the Chinese vision of a \\n\\ncommunity with a shared future for mankind, advocating for cooperative and symbiotic \\n\\nrelationships between states. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Latin America's integration efforts should reflect the principles of symbiosis and solidarity, \\n\\nmirroring the Chinese approach to international cooperation. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n48 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The concept of a community with a shared future offers a new framework for international \\n\\ncooperation based on common values, shared intentions, and mutual support, aiming to \\n\\nreplace hostile dynamics with collaborative and innovative solutions \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Tahir Hijazi, Former Member Governance, Planning Commission \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cSocio-Economic aspects of projects in CPEC Phase-I\\u201d \\n\\nIt is a privilege to address you today on the socio-economic aspects of the projects undertaken \\n\\nduring the first phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). As we reflect on the \\n\\ntransformative impact of these projects, it is essential to recognize the immense opportunities \\n\\nthey have brought to Pakistan, especially in terms of employment and economic growth. \\n\\nPakistan, as many of you know, is one of the most populous countries in the world, ranking \\n\\namong the top five globally. This youthful population is on the cusp of entering the workforce, \\n\\nand as they do, the demand for jobs will inevitably surge. The CPEC initiative, Pakistan\\u2019s most \\n\\nsignificant development project to date, has been instrumental in addressing this pressing need. \\n\\nFrom its inception, CPEC has been envisioned as a catalyst for economic development and job \\n\\ncreation in Pakistan. The Planning \\n\\nCommission projected that CPEC would \\n\\ngenerate 1.6 million jobs by 2030. While \\n\\nthis ambitious target captured the \\n\\nimagination of many, the early phases of the \\n\\nproject revealed a gap between the skills of \\n\\njob seekers and the opportunities available. \\n\\nHowever, rather than a setback, this \\n\\nmismatch has served as a call to action\\u2014prompting us to align our educational and vocational \\n\\ntraining programs with the needs of a rapidly evolving job market. Despite these early \\n\\nchallenges, the impact of CPEC on employment in Pakistan has been profound. The \\n\\ninfrastructure and energy projects completed under CPEC Phase-I have not only enhanced the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n49 \\n \\n\\nnation\\u2019s physical and economic landscape but have also directly created approximately 70,000 \\n\\njobs. These opportunities have been vital in reducing unemployment and have had a ripple effect \\n\\nthroughout the economy, contributing significantly to Pakistan\\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \\n\\nMoreover, CPEC\\u2019s influence extends beyond the borders of Pakistan. The project has also \\n\\ngenerated employment in China, both directly and indirectly, showcasing the mutual benefits of \\n\\nthis landmark initiative. The economic linkages forged through CPEC have strengthened the \\n\\nbond between our two nations, creating a framework for shared prosperity and regional stability. \\n\\nIt is crucial to understand that the socio-economic benefits of CPEC are not limited to job \\n\\ncreation alone. The infrastructure \\n\\nimprovements brought about by \\n\\nCPEC have had a transformative \\n\\neffect on Pakistan\\u2019s economy. The \\n\\nenhanced road networks, upgraded \\n\\nports, and improved energy supply \\n\\nhave not only facilitated commerce \\n\\nand trade but have also provided a \\n\\nsolid foundation for future industrial growth. These developments have attracted investment, \\n\\nboth domestic and foreign, creating a more dynamic and competitive economic environment. \\n\\nThe reduction in unemployment and the subsequent economic growth have also had positive \\n\\nsocial implications. As more people find gainful employment, we see improvements in living \\n\\nstandards, better access to education and healthcare, and overall enhanced quality of life. CPEC \\n\\nhas, in many ways, been a driver of social progress, helping to uplift communities across the \\n\\ncountry. \\n\\nLooking ahead, the lessons learned from Phase-I of CPEC will be invaluable as we move into the \\n\\nnext phases of the project. It is imperative that we continue to focus on skills development and \\n\\ncapacity building to ensure that the Pakistani workforce is equipped to meet the demands of a \\n\\nrapidly changing job market. By doing so, we can maximize the socio-economic benefits of \\n\\nCPEC, ensuring that the fruits of this partnership are shared widely and equitably. The socio-\\n\\neconomic impact of CPEC Phase-I has been overwhelmingly positive. The jobs created, the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n50 \\n \\n\\ninfrastructure built, and the economic growth stimulated by these projects have laid a strong \\n\\nfoundation for Pakistan\\u2019s future.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Planning Commission projected that CPEC would generate 1.6 million jobs by 2030. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The economic linkages forged through CPEC have strengthened the bond between our two \\n\\nnations, creating a framework for shared prosperity and regional stability. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The enhanced road networks, upgraded ports, and improved energy supply have not only \\n\\nfacilitated commerce and trade but have also provided a solid foundation for future industrial \\n\\ngrowth. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Prof. Dr. Muhammad Saleem Mazhar, Director General, National Language \\n\\nPromotion Department, Government of Pakistan \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cPromoting Cultural Diversity among nations for a Harmonious shared future for \\n\\nMankind\\u201d \\n\\nI am thankful that you have provided me with the opportunity to say something about this. It is \\n\\nan established fact that individuals, societies, and \\n\\nstates develop understanding, become closer, and \\n\\nsharehappiness and sorrows with each other \\n\\nthrough cultural relations. Language literature \\n\\nFine Arts paintings and music are the main \\n\\ncomponent of culture which facilitates all types \\n\\nof relations and helps in developing friendships \\n\\nbetween different societies. It is only and only \\n\\nthe culture that attracts individuals that attracts \\n\\nand includes all and does not allow anyone to go. It is why states establish cultural relations with \\n\\nother states in order to create understanding between them and serve humanity. Because of these \\n\\nrelations, man-to-man contacts are established, and it is culture that becomes the basis of all ties, \\n\\nlike social, economic, political, financial, and technological. Culture converts strangers into \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n51 \\n \\n\\nfriends; it separates love and peace. Harmony tolerance respects differences of opinion and \\n\\ninspires people to follow the coexistence principle without any discrimination based on colour, \\n\\ncaste, or creed. There is no doubt that in this era of globalisation connectivity and information \\n\\nflow, no individual or society can survive in isolation. The lynchpin of all developments and \\n\\nprogress is creating understanding between societies and nations, which leads to an enlightened \\n\\nmoderate respectful of the moral, ethical, social, and cultural values of a particular nation. \\n\\nNations and states have become the keys to success and progress for a nation. The Asian region, \\n\\nwith its young, hardworking, and talented youth population and area, is rich in terms of its \\n\\nhuman and natural resources, capital, and intellectual analysts. Experts in international relations \\n\\nare unanimously of the view that the 21st century is the century of the rise of Asia. The very \\n\\nrapid development and progress of China are provided, proving this fact that the Asian region \\n\\nand China's inclusive and collaborative approach to policy formation and execution is making \\n\\nwonders. China's rapid progress in all fields is exemplary at the present time. China's ancient \\n\\ncivilization Chinese have presented three very essential and valuable gifts to the world and \\n\\nHumanity these are invention of compass printing press and paper that have provided with the \\n\\nbase for socioeconomic development in coming centuries at present times China is working \\n\\nenthusiastically for socioeconomics cultural and civilizational development of the world in order \\n\\nto serve humanity and create Harmony in all societies. The belt and Road initiative (BRI) and \\n\\nChina Pakistan economic corridor (CPEC) is Corridor of peace and prosperity for all China's \\n\\nVisionary leadership has reached to this golden principle and conclusion and aim and objective \\n\\nthat the only way of progress is in Sharing resources supporting helping supporting and helping \\n\\neach other to contribute towards a vibrant tolerant Society therefore they have presented concept \\n\\nof community with shared future. \\n\\nIt is appreciable that for the last 35 years China has not fired a single bullet from its s to any \\n\\nstate; it is separating peace, harmony, and prosperity at Globe. China has very clearly explained \\n\\nseveral times that it respects and regards all cultures and has no intention to interfere in any \\n\\nculture or tradition related to any nation or society. Pakistan and China are time tested friends of \\n\\nall times their sincere friendship is an example for the whole world in the era of BRI and CPEC.  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n52 \\n \\n\\nThere is need of time to strengthen cultural literary and academic relations between both the \\n\\nnations to achieve this cultural artists academicians researchers and students exchange programs \\n\\nmay be started universities of both the country should start joint teaching programs and initiate \\n\\njoint research projects to address the problems and issues being faced by the regional countries \\n\\nparticularly Pakistan and China hope this cultural cooperation and academic collaboration will be \\n\\nhelpful for the development of the region which will not only be a win-win situation for both the \\n\\ncountry but will but will serve Humanity \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The very rapid development and progress of China are provided, proving this fact that the \\n\\nAsian region and China's inclusive and collaborative approach to policy formation and \\n\\nexecution is making wonders. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan and China are time tested friends of all times their sincere friendship is an \\n\\nexample for the whole world in the era of BRI and CPEC. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 China is working enthusiastically for socioeconomics cultural and civilizational \\n\\ndevelopment of the world in order to serve humanity and create Harmony in all societies \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n53 \\n \\n\\nKeynote Speech by Senator Sarmad Ali \\n\\nTopic:  \\u201cThe job of Media in enhancing regional connectivity and the framework of Belt & \\n\\nRoad Initiative\\u201d \\n\\nIt is an honour for me to be here today and to talk about the role of media in the Belt and Road \\n\\nInitiative (BRI), which is based on five \\n\\nconnectivities: policy coordination, \\n\\ninfrastructure connectivity, \\n\\ninterconnected trade, financial \\n\\nintegration, and connectivity. \\n\\nHowever, the most important is the \\n\\npeople to people connectivity, it is not \\n\\npossible to bring people together \\n\\nunless we create another connectivity \\n\\nwithin this connectivity, which is media-to-media connectivity, and linkages are actually the \\n\\nbedrock of people-to-people connectivity and the success of BRI and global initiatives. \\n\\nIn today's world, where the flow of information has no boundaries, media plays a very important \\n\\nrole in shaping perceptions for fostering understanding and building cultures. It is imperative that \\n\\nthe media and the BRI partner countries join hands in countering negativity in media. Whoever \\n\\ngets whatever share controls the minds of the people and controls the minds of the media, has the \\n\\nability to shape this real state through shaping our beliefs and forming new truths and \\n\\nperceptions, thus becoming reality, perceptions are actually our reality. Whatever we may say, \\n\\nwhatever we may believe in, but whatever we see, whatever we perceive, unfortunately, in our \\n\\nworld becomes reality.   \\n\\nIt is not what is truth or what is false; it is our perception of whatever we see around us that \\n\\nmakes us believe in it, and we believe we can turn it into reality while the global media has \\n\\njoined forces against the BRI and, of course, CPEC being part of the BRI and often call it the \\n\\nnew form of colonialism. We should come together on one platform to not just counter their \\n\\ntactics but also highlight the true image and spirit of BRI and its plans, milestones, achievements, \\n\\nand way Forward. We talk about G2G connectivity, we talk about B2B connectivity, we talk \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n54 \\n \\n\\nabout g2b connectivity, but I think there's another connectivity that we forget about when we talk \\n\\nabout connectivity, and that is M2M connectivity, or media-to-media connectivity, in today's \\n\\nworld of fake news and disinformation. \\n\\nIt becomes imperative to have similar points of view from around the world get to one point and \\n\\nmay their presence be felt. We live in a world that is dominated by CNN and the BBC of the \\n\\nWorld. Whatever they tell us becomes reality, whatever they tell us becomes truth, and we do not \\n\\ngive our point of view; we do not give our version of truth out there that is also somewhere out \\n\\nthere, but we do not push it; we do not talk about it. And the BBC of the World is using the \\n\\npower of media to change the image of PR. They're using it because they share perceptions, they \\n\\nshare perceptions of the world constantly by hand. \\n\\nPakistan is one of the most important, having 7\\u20138% of the BRI, which is one of the \\n\\nmost important corridors of the Belt and Road Network, why can't we do something to bring \\n\\nmedia outlets to Pakistan and organise the media summit of BRI countries and try to use the \\n\\npower of the media of these countries to counter whatever is being built around BRI and is being \\n\\ntalked about in the West? The power of the media force lies in its ability to transform perceptions \\n\\ninto realities into convictions. Such cooperation will help inform, entertain, educate, and \\n\\ninfluence the people of these countries. So let us use the power of media to foster understanding, \\n\\npromote transparency, and counter misinformation in these countries to enable them to realise \\n\\nthe full potential of this infrastructural and transformative initiative. Otherwise, this will get lost; \\n\\notherwise, we will remain in debating what CPEC is doing for Pakistan and what BRI is doing \\n\\nfor other countries. There is a constant debate going on, and we keep hearing people questioning \\n\\nwhether we should have been part of CPEC or not, or whether CPEC should have been started or \\n\\nnot. \\n\\nBut where are those alternatives going? That is something that we need to sit down and ponder, \\n\\nwhether it is it is whether it is even whether there is even a need to question, um, what is \\n\\nhappening in CPEC, and this can only be done if media gets together. If media in Pakistan gets \\n\\ntogether with media in China with media in other parts of BRI, this can only happen when we \\n\\nbring them all together.  In today's world, it is more true than it was 10 years ago, 15 years ago, \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n55 \\n \\n\\nor 20 years ago. Today, perception makes us what we are. Today, perception makes the world \\n\\nsee us for who we are. \\n\\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 In today's world, where the flow of information has no boundaries, media plays a very \\n\\nimportant role in shaping perceptions for fostering understanding and building cultures. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 We talk about G2G connectivity, we talk about B2B connectivity, we talk about g2b \\n\\nconnectivity, but I think there's another connectivity that we forget about when we talk about \\n\\nconnectivity, and that is M2M connectivity, or media-to-media connectivity. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 It is imperative that the media and the BRI partner countries join hands in countering \\n\\nnegativity in media. We should come together on one platform to not just counter their tactics \\n\\nbut also highlight the true image and spirit of BRI and its plans, milestones, achievements, \\n\\nand way Forward.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n56 \\n \\n\\nSpeech byProf. Dr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal, Dean Social Sciences, Quaid-i-Azam University, \\n\\nIslamabad \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cGlobal Security Initiatives and its Impact on World\\u2019s Geo-Political Situation\\u201d \\n\\nWhen we look at the transformation in global politics, we find that there's been a big transition \\n\\ntaking place. Western unipolarity is \\n\\ngiving way to multipolarity, and \\n\\nPresident Xi and President Putin \\n\\nare very determined in these global \\n\\ndynamics. So when we look at \\n\\nthese American and Chinese \\n\\nstrategic contests, we find that they \\n\\nare very much influencing global \\n\\npolitics. Recent developments \\n\\nindicate that Beijing is determined \\n\\nto prevent washing political military arrangements to check China's. \\n\\nAnd in this context, the American Chinese have come up with their global strategic vision, or \\n\\nwhat we call their global security initiative. I'm going to address two questions: first, what is the \\n\\nGlobal Security Initiative and how do we look at it?; and second, how has the has the Global \\n\\nSecurity Initiative received and responded to by the International Community? Having said this, \\n\\nthe vision and efforts for global development, peace, and security through diplomacy and \\n\\neconomic cooperation are enshrined in three international initiatives. 2022 Global Security \\n\\nInitiative, or prior to that, 2021 Global Development Initiative, and then follow up last year, \\n\\n2023 Global Civilisation Initiative. All these initiatives are very much, you can say, overdue, but \\n\\nthe Global Security Initiative makes a lot of difference. What is the primary concept of this \\n\\nglobal security initiative? It advocates the concept ofindivisible security and that no single \\n\\nnation's security should come at the expense of others. This concept of invisible security we had \\n\\nalready seen when there was a sinking accord between the Russians and the Americans in 1975 \\n\\nduring the Cold War, and trustingly, when we trace the Global Security Initiative Evolution or a \\n\\nbackground, we find that the Chinese have been working on it. For instance, in 1997, they came \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n57 \\n \\n\\nup with the concept of the new security concept, later referred to as universal security and \\n\\nincreasingly as invisible and cooperative security, which was promoted to the centrality of the \\n\\nUnited Nations and the United Nations Charter, emphasising the multipolarity of multi-security \\n\\narchitectures, cooperation dialogue, and giving a way against collective security. It advocates six \\n\\ndifferent ways precisely when we look at it, but the most important emphasis of this global \\n\\nsecurity initiative is that to emphasise and work according to the United Nations Charter, it's \\n\\nvery interesting, just as what the liberalist economic world or liberal democratic world after 1945 \\n\\narticulated. \\n\\nNow President Xi is articulating through his Global Security. In this context, when he was \\n\\nemphasising the Cyber Security United Nations Charter, at the same time it was bridging a gap \\n\\nbetween traditional and non-traditional security and advocating to address through consensus \\n\\nnew emerging challenges or existing challenges like terrorism, climate change, cyber security, \\n\\nand biosecurity. I think it's a big thing when we talk about biosecurity in modern times. He wants \\n\\na nuclear war that cannot be won and must never be fought; therefore, there's a need to have a \\n\\nGlobal Security Initiative (GSI) that opposes the Cold War mentality of unilateralism and blocks \\n\\nconfrontation and hegemony. \\n\\nIn this context, when we look at this dialogue, we find that after the initiative, we have seen the \\n\\nChinese do good work when there was a report engineered by the Chinese in March 2023 \\n\\nbetween Saudi Arabia and Iran. In this Global Security Initiative (GSI), they have also \\n\\nrecommended in 2022 and again when it was republicized Concept in 2023 two-state solution \\n\\neven of a Palestine crisis even prior to the start of the Gaza war in October, so by this way we \\n\\ncan find that they also recommended Russian and Ukrainian settlement through the dialogue \\n\\nanyway. Now my second part is global development and how the world is moving and where we \\n\\nadjust it. I think this era of soft power or too much using \\n\\nIt has disturbed the Western Nations because they interpreted GSI as a challenge to the Western-\\n\\nled global governance system and an alternative to us. The International World Order Global \\n\\nSecurity Initiative is a component of a larger push to establish a post-Western multiple world and \\n\\nset global agendas that reflect the interests and values ofLike other great powers, China pursues \\n\\nthe national interest, but as a rising superpower, it also seeks to establish its global leadership. It \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n58 \\n \\n\\ndelegitimizes a collective and highly material security approach, so unlike the United States \\n\\nsecurity order, the Global Security Initiative links security with development and emphasises \\n\\nnon-traditional security issues. But what is the outcome of this conflict? \\n\\nPresident Xi Jinping announced the Global Security Initiative, so when I look at these things, \\n\\nwhat is my understanding of them? China's Global Security Initiative seems benign for the \\n\\nnation's diplomatic, economic, and civilizational progress because it cultivates a network of \\n\\nfriendly international and regional relationships, second only to the Cold War mentality. \\n\\nRegional global hegemonies\\u2019 and power politics threaten world peace and prosperity; therefore, \\n\\nthe Global Security Initiative is a remarkable work against the militaristic policies of the United \\n\\nStates and Allies. \\n\\nGSI emphasised partnership for alliances and advocates that the disputes could be resolved \\n\\nthrough dialogue instead of use of force, for therefore it's in the best interest of the nations, \\n\\nincluding Pakistan, which is very much advocating neutrality in international politics. My final \\n\\npoint here is that it is equally important to prevent the escalation ofconflict at five nuclear flash \\n\\npoints. So GSI is good to prevent conflict at the first nuclear flash point, which we call Kashmir. \\n\\nIt's good to prevent the second Korean penuela and the and the third Ukrainian penuela. \\n\\nEuropean flash point fourth Taiwan and fifth Gaza War My final submission is that the Global \\n\\nSecurity Initiative (GSI) also supports United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540, which \\n\\ndemands the use of UN legislation domestic laws for the prevention of chemical, biological, \\n\\nnuclear, and logical terrorism within the state or preventing these kinds of weapons from falling \\n\\ninto the hands of non-state actors. Finally, I can say the Global Security Initiative (GSI) is a good \\n\\nway to address traditional and non-traditional security challenges in global politics. \\n\\n Key Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The ongoing shift in global politics from Western unipolarity to a multipolar world. This \\n\\ntransition is largely driven by strategic contests between the United States, China, and \\n\\nRussia, with China's Global Security Initiative (GSI) emerging as a key framework for \\n\\nshaping the new global order. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n59 \\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Global Security Initiative advocates for \\\"indivisible security,\\\" where the security of any \\n\\ncountry is linked to the security of others in the region. This principle opposes the notion that \\n\\none nation's security can come at the expense of another, promoting a cooperative approach \\n\\nto global security issues. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Global Security Initiative is seen as an alternative to the Western-led global governance \\n\\nsystem. It links security with development, addressing both traditional and non-traditional \\n\\nsecurity challenges such as terrorism, climate change, and cybersecurity.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The importance of the GSI in preventing the escalation of conflicts, particularly at nuclear \\n\\nflashpoints like Kashmir, the Korean Peninsula, Ukraine, Taiwan, and Gaza. The initiative \\n\\nadvocates for resolving disputes through dialogue rather than force, and it supports the \\n\\nimplementation of international resolutions like UN Security Council Resolution 1540 to \\n\\nprevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by Prof. Dr. Anwar Ahmed, Sector Specialist, Planning Commission \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cAgricultural Cooperation and Food Security\\u201d \\n\\nPakistan has 225 million people, with 60% of the of the population below the age of 30, and it is \\n\\na blessing that we can do much with this 60% \\n\\npopulation. It is also very important because \\n\\nit has tremendous potential for global \\n\\ninvestors and companies, has the largest \\n\\nirrigated land, is the centre of China, India, \\n\\nand the Middle East, where we have several \\n\\nopportunities, and is the home of Asian \\n\\ncivilisation and some of the highest and most \\n\\nbeautiful ranges as well. \\n\\nPakistan is a blessed country, and if we see that in every livestock sector, Pakistan's GDP is \\n\\n1/5th, which is generated from agriculture and livestock. We are 12th in buffalo, third in goats, \\n\\nfourth in cotton production, and fifth in sugarcane production. We are ninth in wheat and sheet. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n60 \\n \\n\\nIt is a great opportunity for Pakistan to harvest the potential of CPEC. The livestock sector in the \\n\\nnational economy is also contributing a lot because we have a wide population of livestock in \\n\\npottery. We can attract private sector investment of 1.05 per trillion in pottery and similar levels \\n\\nin the daily and lead sectors. There is opportunity for over 2 million people for employment as \\n\\nwell as mechanics for primary resources for investment, but having such potential here is the \\n\\ngrowth pattern, and we are having a declining trend in agriculture as regards the GDP and crops \\n\\nof the sector.  So why are we declining? Here are some challenges: we have low productivity in \\n\\nagriculture, a high import bill, low profitability and competitiveness, and low diversification. We \\n\\nhave only five major props. degraded land resources and natural resources, as well as declining \\n\\nin the rural sector in terms of trade and equity implications. We have poor technology adoption, \\n\\nbut we have opportunities in the form of modern technology for Grand Revolution 2.0, which is \\n\\nthe prime minister initiative that just started this year. Our institutional reforms are not opening, \\n\\nand the current government has started some Prime Minister initiatives regarding food security, \\n\\nwhich are generated by the IPC integrated food security phase classification, in which we are \\n\\nfalling on a medium food in a city or country. \\n\\nIt is the global perspective of the current food system and what are the future challenges that our \\n\\npopulation is expanding and we need much food for them as well. We need to prevent \\n\\nagriculture from expanding because of the potential we are harvestingis not sufficient uh the \\n\\nhidden potential which is much more higher than the actual potential of our uh agriculture \\n\\ngrowth so in this context following friends are shaping our future food system then there is \\n\\nclimate change we are evolving consumption preferences and in nutrition and health rapid \\n\\ntechnological change and innovation as well as localised development and strong stakeholder \\n\\nengagement and demographic changes. these are the driving forces which are achieving our \\n\\nfoodSecurity here is the Nexus of Agriculture, Energy, and Water, which is a catastrophe \\n\\nforPakistan and we are being behind in achieving this. We need food, we need water, and we \\n\\nneed energy to run to achieve the intended objectives.  \\n\\nThis is another social dilemma that poses major challenges to food and security in Pakistan. \\n\\nRising population urbanisation is diversifying diet patterns. increased food demand as well as \\n\\nrising food pricespurchasing power-falling water tables Low irrigation efficiency increases \\n\\nsoilErosion, as well as climate change depleting water reserves, is also a big challenge. Limited \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n61 \\n \\n\\nland availability, food losses, and food-based products are the major challenges and inefficient \\n\\ndiversification of foods. Now, what is an option for us? That is, the technological development in \\n\\nthe world. We are seeing innovations in food packagingtechnology, new methods of food \\n\\nproduction such as 3D printing, as well as the application of automation, artificial intelligence, \\n\\nbig data, and blockchain technology. \\n\\nThese are the recent options for us, so smart irrigation is the innovative technology, which we \\n\\ncan use to save our irrigation water. Drone technology is also coming to agriculture, and we are \\n\\nusing drones to spray our fields in urban agriculture. We also have a new trend that if we utilise \\n\\nurban agriculture, we can Harvest our house-level V vegetables and fruits, and uh, there are new \\n\\nsources of foods coming. For example, edal insect cell-based food production technology as well \\n\\nas the production of SE, or macro-forming of shellfish protein, is also entering our food chain, \\n\\nand insects are amazing as well as altering meat. In spite of alternate meat, we are using the \\n\\nvegetables, and our food scientists are changing those vegetables into the shape of meat that \\n\\ntastes just like meat, and it is a new development.For example, we have the economic zones; if \\n\\nwe develop them and link them with the villages, we have a great potential for trade as well as \\n\\nexport tourism opportunities. organic farming management and the and the adoption of water-\\n\\nsaving techniques marketing of crops, employment opportunities promotion of rice exports every \\n\\nLogistics cotton processing units productivity of the livestock sector tobacco value chain palm \\n\\noil production portal, industry development, and range lands. \\n\\nThe new initiatives, which can be developed through CPEC, give us a bright future now that this \\n\\ngovernment is a sector special in the Planning Commission of Pakistan. I have gone through all \\n\\nthese projects that we are doing for our food security. For example, just the prime minister of \\n\\nPakistan started a solarization of agriculture project in Pakistan, whose total cost is 377 billion \\n\\nrupees. All the provinces that have participated agreed on this project, and its authorisation has \\n\\nbeen done. It will be started in the next month with another project, Green Revolution 2.0. \\n\\n It is a prime minister initiative that proposes intervention for Green Revolution 2.0. It is a $5 \\n\\nmillion project and it will supply machinery demand; it will give demonstrations to farmers for it \\n\\nwill raise nursery kitchen gardening; capacity building and linkage will be developed; and \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n62 \\n \\n\\nlivestock will be given to social mobilisation and establishment of endowment funds through \\n\\nPRC. The Pakistan Agriculture Research Council will be developed for research in agriculture. \\n\\nIts total cost is 5 billion rupees. The cluster development programme, which is also a prime \\n\\nminister initiative, and in which the concept of food cluster agriculture cluster was studied in the \\n\\nPlanning Commission, in which the clusters were identified as mango Citrus  Apple, apricot, \\n\\ntomato, potato, onion, garlic, and different districts of all the provinces of Pakistan have been \\n\\nidentified in which these interventions will be delivered, and technological interventions are \\n\\nprocessing capacity building, research, and development in agriculture. These are the new PSDP \\n\\nprojects on food security; a unit of research and development has been introduced in the \\n\\nministry; establishment of the Pakistan animal identification and crossability system; national \\n\\nprogram on animal disease surveillance; national agriculture productivity; management \\n\\nprofessionals; national multi-sectoral nutrition program; establishment of Pak-Korean nutrition  \\n\\nMore than 137 billion hectares of livestock have been approved for the province of CPEC. \\n\\nExport initiatives should be taken, as well as skill development, and CPEC should be utilised for \\n\\nR&D development as well as export development. The 5D framework has a significant potential \\n\\nto achieve these objectives of shared future. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan, with its vast irrigated lands and significant livestock sector, holds tremendous \\n\\npotential for agricultural growth and investment. Despite being a leading producer of various \\n\\ncrops like cotton and sugarcane, Pakistan's agriculture sector is currently underperforming \\n\\ndue to challenges such as low productivity, poor technology adoption, and declining \\n\\nprofitability. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Technological advancements such as smart irrigation, drone technology, automation, \\n\\nartificial intelligence, and new methods of food production (e.g., 3D printing and cell-based \\n\\nfoods) are seen as key to overcoming Pakistan's agricultural challenges. These innovations \\n\\noffer opportunities to improve productivity, reduce resource use, and introduce sustainable \\n\\nagricultural practices. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The government has launched several initiatives to bolster food security and agricultural \\n\\ndevelopment. Projects like the Green Revolution 2.0, solarization of agriculture, and various \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n63 \\n \\n\\ncluster development programs aim to enhance productivity, promote sustainable practices, \\n\\nand develop export-oriented agriculture. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a critical framework for driving \\n\\ninvestment, research, and development in the agricultural sector. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech byDr. Fouzia Hadi Ali, Director, Regional Integration Centre, University of the \\n\\nPunjab, Lahore  \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cImpact of Shared Economic Development for building a community with shared \\n\\nfuture\\u201d \\n\\nMy discussion and my speech rest on where we are. Rightly said, TV is very below it when it \\n\\ncomes to different indexes, and one of the grave \\n\\nthings that you can see is in the Sustainable \\n\\nDevelopment Index. Pakistan is also in the 2024 \\n\\nIndex Report on Number 137. So the thing is, when \\n\\nit comes to Pakistan and the opportunities lying \\n\\nbetween in terms of the China-Pakistan Economic \\n\\nCorridor and the kind of aspect that we are deficient \\n\\nupon,. \\n\\nPeople would agree that we have to conduct a gap \\n\\nanalysis to see what we're good at, what we're doing, what we have to learn, and what we have to \\n\\nfill in that gap. May we offer something we're good at and something we have to learn from \\n\\nothers, especially from the projects that are going on, and the biggest if you can see the foreign \\n\\ndirect investment comes from China? \\n\\nSo the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) advocates a little bit more. I know that you \\n\\nmust have your own perspective. We stand at a crossroads of  history,  Our world is more \\n\\ninterconnected than ever before, we face challenge the threat to divide us to an end complex one \\n\\nprinciple shine brightly a beacon of hope and progress is shared economic development.This \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n64 \\n \\n\\nprinciple is not just an economic strategy but a vision for building a community with a shared \\n\\nfuture. Building a community with a shared future is often associated with cooperative and \\n\\ninclusive development strategies that aim to create mutual benefits for all participants. When it \\n\\ncomes to shared economic development, this concept emphasises collaboration, interdependence, \\n\\nand equitable growth. \\n\\nThe first thing that we have to look into is the pooling of resources by sharing resources. \\n\\nKnowledge and technologies Communities can achieve more significant economic growth. \\n\\nImagine the power of combining our innovation and expertise to create more efficient production \\n\\nsystems, springing local industries, and making us more comparatively marketable.In 2020, \\n\\nglobal GDP will grow by just 3.5 percent because of the pandemic. But we have seen a lot of \\n\\nsurge in the IT-based industry during the same pandemic because lots of physical businesses \\n\\nswitched over to a more online system, and there were certain opportunities from the \\n\\nuncertainties that existed.Then again, one of the aspects relates to the shared economic \\n\\ndevelopment allowance for risk diversification. \\n\\nEconomic shocks in one area can be mitigated by the stability and growth in another. Leading to \\n\\noverall economic silence. Think of it as a safety net, a show assuring that one part of a \\n\\ncommunity faces challenges and others can provide support for strong stability. This is essential \\n\\nfor building resilient infrastructure and fostering innovation, as highlighted in the inclusive \\n\\nInnovation Infrastructure SDG 9. \\n\\nOver the past decades, one of \\n\\nthe aspects relates to the \\n\\nreduction of inequality. If you \\n\\njust look at our region \\n\\nthrough Central Asia, \\n\\nPakistan, and most of the \\n\\ncountries around us, if you \\n\\njust look at the population, \\n\\nhalf of the population is male \\n\\nand female, but when it \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n65 \\n \\n\\ncomes to the participation of women in economic activity, it's negligible. So that means that \\n\\nwhere the economy has a lot of female participation, their economic growth could even be \\n\\namplified. So that's something that we have to contemplate and think about. \\n\\nThen, this can also reduce income and opportunity dispersion within communities. So Than We \\n\\nCan Talk About As It Was Mentioned About Higher Education Also That a Higher Education is \\n\\nan important and pivotal Aspect Relating to Bringing Innovation So the Problem Arises Before It \\n\\nComes To Pakistan Instead of actually comparing innovation with the US and UK, of course we \\n\\nare very, very far behind, and I think it will take as long as Another year may be two and the \\n\\nsummer may be gone, and we're still striving towards them, but the thing we can do is what I \\n\\nsuggest, and I have been suggesting a number of times. \\n\\nOur industries are far behind in terms of the skill level that is required, if you just look at the \\n\\nbiggest exporting areas. For instance, we are exporting a lot of sports products, but when you just \\n\\ngo and look into the industries, they are not up to the mark of the international standards, which \\n\\nmeans \\n\\nWe can invite different trainers from different countries, especially China, and we can actually \\n\\nstart working together with the academics, and they can provide the platform. There is an extra \\n\\nexpense for the government to cover. Because it can be a win-win situation where trainers could \\n\\nuse the platform at the university level, youth are already there, and you just need to make a \\n\\nconnection with them. \\n\\nSocial cohesion and trust are, of course, two of the biggest challenges, as Doctor Jaspal said \\n\\nabout the security aspect. You know the biggest challenge is that we are far behind; we are \\n\\nproviding security facilities; and we are our biggest investors who are providing us with FDI. \\n\\nYou've seen a number of things that have happened and that have made us quiet, but certain \\n\\ninsecurities among the Chinese counterparts have prevented us from continuing with the project \\n\\nas well. So one of the important aspects is conflict reduction, and that can be done only if we are \\n\\nmore connected. The more economic activity we can do with regional countries, the better we \\n\\ncould be, and everybody would know that we are economically connected with each other. If \\n\\nthere is a conflict, it will be harmful for everybody. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n66 \\n \\n\\nThe instance was a talk about the environment: that we have to adopt green technology \\n\\nconservation efforts and policies because, as you know, when it comes to climate issues, we are \\n\\nfacing a lot of smog, a lot of global warming issues are turning up, and we're witnessing more \\n\\nfloods and a lot of other things. That's where we have to collaborate with the regional countries \\n\\nto address this. This is the basic underlying reason behind facing true climate issues. So one of \\n\\nthe aspects has already been discussed: cultural exchange and understanding. Of course, \\n\\ninnovation and creativity can be spread if diverse people from diverse institutions and regions \\n\\ncombine together and actually develop a global citizenship where we learn from each other, their \\n\\nwork ethic, and how people learn to work together.  \\n\\nThe vision of the honourable President of China also offers this global development initiative \\n\\n(SDI), also related to the sustainable development initiative, and that's where I think that by \\n\\npromoting inclusive growth, prosperity, social cohesion, understanding, and strengthening \\n\\npolitical-economic ties. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Shared economic development is not just an economic strategy but a vision for creating a \\n\\ncommunity with a shared future. This approach emphasizes collaboration, interdependence, \\n\\nand equitable growth, allowing communities to pool resources, knowledge, and technologies \\n\\nto achieve more significant economic progress and resilience. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Opportunities lie in leveraging initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) \\n\\nto fill gaps in skills, technology, and infrastructure, potentially transforming the country's \\n\\neconomic landscape. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan's industries need to elevate their standards to meet international levels, which can be \\n\\nachieved through collaborations with foreign trainers and academics. This would enhance the \\n\\nskill levels required in key exporting sectors, ultimately boosting the country's global \\n\\ncompetitiveness. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Additionally, addressing environmental challenges like climate change and smog requires \\n\\ncollaboration with neighboring countries to adopt green technologies and conservation \\n\\nefforts, ensuring sustainable development for all. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n67 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Dr. Najeeb Ullah, Former Member, Science and Technology \\n\\nTopic on: \\u201cCPEC Phase-II and Socio-Economic Development through Technological \\n\\nAdvancements\\u201d \\n\\nThe neo-classical growth model is very important, and according to the neo-classical growth \\n\\nmodel, there are three components: K \\n\\nand L. A means the knowledge part; A \\n\\nmeans the higher education; a means the \\n\\nhidden part, which you might not see; \\n\\nit's not the infrastructure.According to \\n\\nthis model, if you invest in knowledge, \\n\\nthere will be growth. The second part is \\n\\nthe k, which means the FBI, the foreign \\n\\ndirect investment, and the capital. If \\n\\nthere is capital, there will be growth. \\n\\nThen the third and last one is the L skill labour. If you have three components: education, quality \\n\\nhigher education, the hidden part, capital, and the skill labour, we can expect growth, and if one \\n\\nof the parts is missing, forget about innovation, forget about economic growth. That's his \\n\\nstatement, not my statement.  \\n\\nMoving on to MIT, one of the best universities in the world, they say the innovation ecosystem \\n\\nhas five components rather than three, and these five components are the universities, then the \\n\\ngovernment, then the private corporate sector. These were called the emerging Tri triple helix \\n\\nmodel, and now they have added two more. One is the capital landscape; it's very important, but \\n\\npartiality is completely missing in Pakistan, and then along with this one is the mindset of the \\n\\nentrepreneurs. If you have these five components, there will be a knowledge-based economy, \\n\\nthere will be an economy, and there will be economic growth.So I would like to talk about these \\n\\nfive components today, and now let me tell you where we stand in innovation. We are in the 88th \\n\\nposition in the world. Innovation is not one component.  \\n\\nInnovation is one of the five components, and these are all cross-linked to get about innovation \\n\\nand economic growth. According to the GII, these are called the innovation inputs.What are \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n68 \\n \\n\\nthese five? The first one is the institution. These institutions are the political environment, the \\n\\nstability; these are the regulatory environment; and these are the business environment. If these \\n\\nare there, things will grow; the second one is called human capital and research education. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the tertiary education is the higher education, and along with this one, it's \\n\\ncovered with the R&D model. The next one is the infrastructure, the ICT, and then the fourth one \\n\\nis the market sophistication, the capital, the investment, and then the last one is the business \\n\\nsophistication, the knowledge work. As I mentioned, that's basically the skill label, and then \\n\\nbasically there are two outputs now. 5.5 in the region, I'm talking about India, 4%. \\n\\nSo that's why you always see that there should be 4% for education, but that's \\n\\ntherecommendation that rather than the 2% it should be 4% see the missing links now that's the \\n\\ngovernment part that's not me that's not universities the second one this one the gross expenditure \\n\\nof the R&D is very important see now this is only 164 and again when I was at the it was very \\n\\nalarming 64% nothing so what we say what we recommend that it should be at least 1% the \\n\\nleading in the world my example Israel is 6% was 6% already and we just1 6% see that's these \\n\\nthe figures next. \\n\\nand they have done very well, I mean relatively well, so they have actually awarded some of the \\n\\ngrants. That's a good point, but then see that the IC, as I mentioned, is one of the very important \\n\\nparameters. We are gradually at one of three positions out of 132; they're at the bottom, so we \\n\\nhave to rectify the ICT infrastructure, the investment, the internet speed, the internet access, and \\n\\nthen basically what we see is actually the Venture Capital Fund. Nowadays, people don't believe \\n\\nin the banking system. I will share with you what the new landscapes are for the venture \\n\\ncapitalism and the private equity fund. It's nothing, 81% of the GDP, and then basically, it's the \\n\\nknowledge employment. We are at the one2 position in the technical employment, which means \\n\\nwe don't need engineers because we don't have the technical, uh, private corporate sector. \\n\\n So that's why basically that's very alarming unless and until we see in all dimensions things will \\n\\nbe missing because if you are producing engineers and if there is no technical need for the \\n\\ncorporate tech enterprises this is where we are to so it should be two-way traffic now talking \\n\\nabout the outputs and in the output I think we are at the 43 position that's the huge index because \\n\\nof the higher education since 2002 they've invested a lot and I think that's one of the good \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n69 \\n \\n\\nposition we are rank at 43 position but what is the impact of this Edge index what is the impact \\n\\nof this research.  \\n\\nIt's very important to know that there are basically these four levels: one is the concept level of \\n\\nthe product, the second is the development, then the pre-commercialization and early \\n\\ncommercialisation, and then the scale. the big companies 1 billion and you need different levels \\n\\nof investment in this in Pakistan.  \\n\\nI can say this in comparison to the UK and America then the Venture Capital fund I have \\n\\nVenture Capital is almost zero and then we don't have the big investment in private Equity funds \\n\\nand we don't have the loans for Innovation as it is in New America so we have only one part the \\n\\nsmall part of the ground and that's we always talking about the concept nothing is coming out \\n\\nunless and until we transfer the capital landscape and that should be at the Strategic level of the \\n\\ncountry or the province we will not move but that's the first harsh reality we have to change it let \\n\\nme tell you the figures in UK it's 24 29.4 billion pounds the private equity and Adventure Capital \\n\\nfunds and then so on and see the Red Zone in Pakistan it's only $74 million so no comparison at \\n\\nall.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 According to the neo-classical growth model, economic growth hinges on three key \\n\\ncomponents: knowledge (education and innovation), capital (foreign direct investment), and \\n\\nskilled labor. These elements must be present for sustained economic development, \\n\\ninnovation, and technological advancement. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is the for a comprehensive innovation ecosystem, which includes universities, \\n\\ngovernment support, private sector involvement, capital availability, and an entrepreneurial \\n\\nmindset. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan faces significant challenges in its technological and innovation sectors, including \\n\\ninadequate investment in research and development (R&D), poor ICT infrastructure, and a \\n\\nlack of venture capital.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 For Pakistan to achieve significant socio-economic development through technological \\n\\nadvancements, there must be a strategic focus on transforming the capital landscape \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n70 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Mufti Muhammad Naeem Rehmat Naeemi, President, Muttahida Ulema \\n\\nCouncil Pakistan \\n\\nTopic:  \\u201cInterfaith Harmony and Peace for the shared future of Mankind\\u201d \\n\\nDuring his speech, Mufti Muhammad Naeem Rehmat Naeemi focused on the theme of \\n\\n\\\"Interfaith Harmony and Peace for the shared future \\n\\nof Mankind,\\\" highlighting the importance of \\n\\npromoting unity, understanding, and cooperation \\n\\namong different religious communities for the \\n\\nbetterment of society and the world at large. His \\n\\nspeech emphasized the significance of mutual respect, \\n\\ntolerance, and dialogue in fostering interfaith \\n\\nharmony and peaceful coexistence, particularly in the \\n\\ncontext of initiatives such as the China-Pakistan \\n\\nEconomic Corridor (CPEC) that aim to enhance connectivity and collaboration between nations. \\n\\nPakistan is making significant progress, and we will continue to do so, InshaAllah. Our esteemed \\n\\nulema have emphasized that interfaith harmony is a key blessing, especially in the context of the \\n\\nChina-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). We have worked across the six provinces of \\n\\nPakistan, recognizing that a nation is built upon two pillars: the country and its religion.As \\n\\nPakistanis, we are a unified nation, embracing both our identity and our faith. We are Muslims, \\n\\nand alongside us, Christians, Jews, Hindus, and Sikhs are our brothers. Together, we represent \\n\\nthe beautiful diversity of Pakistan. If there is peace in our land, our roads will flourish, and \\n\\nprosperity will be visible everywhere. \\n\\nIt is the responsibility of our ulema to spread the message of mutual coexistence. When a person \\n\\nearns a degree, they also take on the duty to protect the wealth, lives, and respect of all people, \\n\\nregardless of their background. We must strive to bring all communities together.Interfaith \\n\\nharmony is essential for the success of CPEC, as it unites people from all walks of life. Our \\n\\npartnership with China is a testament to our brotherhood, and we must fulfill our responsibilities \\n\\nas humans and as Muslims. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n71 \\n \\n\\nFrom our institute, 375 individuals have completed training and earned commissions in the army. \\n\\nWe are prepared to contribute and support the growth and development of Pakistan. Together, \\n\\nwe will build a brighter future for our nation. \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Interfaith harmony is essential for societal peace and national prosperity. The mutual \\n\\nrespect, tolerance, and dialogue among different religious communities are crucial for \\n\\nfostering unity and peaceful coexistence. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 It is responsibility of religious scholars (ulema) to promote messages of coexistence and \\n\\nharmony. Ulema must guide their communities to protect the rights and respect of people \\n\\nfrom all backgrounds, ensuring a peaceful and inclusive society. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Unity and cooperation among diverse communities are vital for the flourishing of China-\\n\\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects and the overall development of the nation. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The importance of collective efforts including those of trained individuals from religious \\n\\ninstitutions, in supporting Pakistan's development and securing a prosperous future for all \\n\\ncitizens. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n72 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by Chief Guest His Excellency Faisal Karim Kundi,  \\n\\nGovernor of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province \\n\\n \\n\\nDuring his speech, Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, H.E Faisal Karim Kundi described CPEC as \\n\\na game changer that will \\n\\nrevolutionize the industrial sector \\n\\nand create new growth \\n\\nopportunities. He acknowledged the \\n\\npivotal role of President Asif Ali \\n\\nZardari in CPEC's inception and \\n\\nhighlighted the project's potential to \\n\\ntransform the lives of millions \\n\\nthrough technological collaboration \\n\\nwith China. Governor Kundi \\n\\nreaffirmed the time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan and expressed optimism about \\n\\nCPEC's positive impact on the regional economy. \\n\\n \\n\\nToday, I am honored to speak about the transformative project that is an instrumental initiative in \\n\\nthe Pakistani socioeconomic landscape, and I would like to share these achievements and \\n\\nimpacts. It is profound to gather at the International Conference on CPEC: Enhancing \\n\\nCommunity with a Shared Future for Mankind. Before you note, just to highlight the \\n\\nachievements of the Pakistan-China Economic Corridor to reform, our enduring duty is to create \\n\\na transformative framework to harness Pakistan's demographic and natural resources.  \\n\\n Balance the regional socioeconomic development and prosperity of our regions. Improving \\n\\npeople lives, focusing on poverty reduction, education, and healthcare \\u060cpromotes domestic peace \\n\\nand stability, fostering a secure environment for investment. This ambitious project aims to boost \\n\\nregional connectivity, develop transnational logistics and infrastructure, and increase trade with \\n\\nSouth Asia, Central Asia, and beyond.  \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n \\n\\nIt also encompasses people-to-people exchanges, economic cooperation, and technology transfer \\n\\nto strengthen our strategic partnership. Strengthening the Pakistan-China relationship, the bond is \\n\\na historic, time-tested friendship. Today, the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a \\n\\ntestament to an enduring partnership, highlighting our shared aspirations for a prosperous \\n\\nfuture. CPEC symbolizes our shared vision for a bright future. One that is built on the principles \\n\\nof mutual respect, trust, and cooperation. Through CPEC, we are not only connecting our \\n\\neconomies but also people, cultures, and histories. We are creating a shared future that is \\n\\npromoted on the principles of equality, justice, and sustainability.  \\n\\nThe China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has achieved numerous milestones, contributing \\n\\nto sustainable Pakistani socioeconomic growth. Some key achievements in infrastructure \\n\\ndevelopment include the include \\n\\nthe construction of modern \\n\\nhighways, motorways, and ports, \\n\\nwhich enhance connectivity and \\n\\nemphasize trade.The development \\n\\nof power plants and energy \\n\\nproduction addresses the country's \\n\\nenergy needs. Industrial \\n\\nexpansion, which is the \\n\\ndevelopment of special economic \\n\\nzones (SEZs), attracts investment and promotes industrial growth.  \\n\\nCPEC has played a vital role in strengthening the Pakistan economy, improving the lives of its \\n\\ncitizens, and enhancing its global standing. We appreciate China's support and look forward to \\n\\ncontinuing cooperation for mutual benefits. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my sincere \\n\\ngratitude to the Chinese government and people for their unwavering support and cooperation. \\n\\nWe have achieved remarkable milestones, and we look forward to continuing our cooperation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) has achieved numerous milestones, \\n\\ncontributing to sustainable Pakistani socioeconomic growth. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\uf0b7 CPEC has played a vital role in strengthening the Pakistan economy, improving the lives of \\n\\nits citizens, and enhancing its global standing. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 CPEC symbolizes our shared vision for a bright future.

This \\n\\nplatform supports building \\n\\nshared culture and arts, \\n\\nenhancing people-to-people \\n\\ncontacts through tourism and \\n\\ntrade, fostering regional \\n\\nconnectivity through initiatives \\n\\nlike the Belt and Road Initiative \\n\\n(BRI) and the Eurasian Region, and promoting research cooperation.PRCCSF calls for closer \\n\\ncoordination between research institutes in Pakistan, China, and other regional countries to pave \\n\\nthe way for joint ventures in multiple areas of mutual interest. We are dedicated to advancing the \\n\\nconcept of a community with a shared future, as championed by President Xi Jinping. Our center \\n\\nhas won the Outstanding Individual Contribution Award from CUC as the top research center \\n\\nglobally for three consecutive years: 2021, 2022, and 2023. \\n\\nIn addition to our focus on enriching research on various aspects of Pakistan-China relations, \\n\\nPRCCSF is deeply involved in significant regional and global developments. Our platform for \\n\\ndialogue and exchange strives towards enhanced cooperation and synergy between the media and \\n\\nacademic communities. The primary aim of organizing this conference is to raise awareness \\n\\nabout the concept of community of shared future and how it is linked with CPEC. We should be \\n\\nsteadfast in our commitment to forging a human community, working towards a shared future for \\n\\nall of humanity. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n12 \\n \\n\\nChina has contributed its strength to building a global community of shared futures with firm \\n\\nconviction and solid actions. This includes promoting high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, \\n\\nimplementing the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global \\n\\nCivilization Initiative, and proposing a range of regional and bilateral initiatives aimed at \\n\\nbuilding communities with shared futures. More countries and people are coming to understand \\n\\nthat this vision serves the common interests of humanity, represents popular calls for peace, \\n\\njustice, and progress, and can create the greatest synergy among all nations for building a better \\n\\nworld.Together, we can achieve remarkable milestones in our shared journey towards enhancing \\n\\nour community with a shared future for mankind.  \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n13 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by \",\n          \", Former Member, Science and Technology \\n\\nTopic on: \\u201cCPEC Phase-II and Socio-Economic Development through Technological \\n\\nAdvancements\\u201d \\n\\nThe neo-classical growth model is very important, and according to the neo-classical growth \\n\\nmodel, there are three components: K \\n\\nand L. A means the knowledge part; A \\n\\nmeans the higher education; a means the \\n\\nhidden part, which you might not see; \\n\\nit's not the infrastructure.According to \\n\\nthis model, if you invest in knowledge, \\n\\nthere will be growth. The second part is \\n\\nthe k, which means the FBI, the foreign \\n\\ndirect investment, and the capital. If \\n\\nthere is capital, there will be growth. \\n\\nThen the third and last one is the L skill labour. If you have three components: education, quality \\n\\nhigher education, the hidden part, capital, and the skill labour, we can expect growth, and if one \\n\\nof the parts is missing, forget about innovation, forget about economic growth. That's his \\n\\nstatement, not my statement.  \\n\\nMoving on to MIT, one of the best universities in the world, they say the innovation ecosystem \\n\\nhas five components rather than three, and these five components are the universities, then the \\n\\ngovernment, then the private corporate sector. These were called the emerging Tri triple helix \\n\\nmodel, and now they have added two more. One is the capital landscape; it's very important, but \\n\\npartiality is completely missing in Pakistan, and then along with this one is the mindset of the \\n\\nentrepreneurs. If you have these five components, there will be a knowledge-based economy, \\n\\nthere will be an economy, and there will be economic growth.So I would like to talk about these \\n\\nfive components today, and now let me tell you where we stand in innovation. We are in the 88th \\n\\nposition in the world. Innovation is not one component.  \\n\\nInnovation is one of the five components, and these are all cross-linked to get about innovation \\n\\nand economic growth. According to the GII, these are called the innovation inputs.What are \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n68 \\n \\n\\nthese five? The first one is the institution. These institutions are the political environment, the \\n\\nstability; these are the regulatory environment; and these are the business environment. If these \\n\\nare there, things will grow; the second one is called human capital and research education. \\n\\nAs I mentioned, the tertiary education is the higher education, and along with this one, it's \\n\\ncovered with the R&D model. The next one is the infrastructure, the ICT, and then the fourth one \\n\\nis the market sophistication, the capital, the investment, and then the last one is the business \\n\\nsophistication, the knowledge work. As I mentioned, that's basically the skill label, and then \\n\\nbasically there are two outputs now. 5.5 in the region, I'm talking about India, 4%. \\n\\nSo that's why you always see that there should be 4% for education, but that's \\n\\ntherecommendation that rather than the 2% it should be 4% see the missing links now that's the \\n\\ngovernment part that's not me that's not universities the second one this one the gross expenditure \\n\\nof the R&D is very important see now this is only 164 and again when I was at the it was very \\n\\nalarming 64% nothing so what we say what we recommend that it should be at least 1% the \\n\\nleading in the world my example Israel is 6% was 6% already and we just1 6% see that's these \\n\\nthe figures next. \\n\\nand they have done very well, I mean relatively well, so they have actually awarded some of the \\n\\ngrants. That's a good point, but then see that the IC, as I mentioned, is one of the very important \\n\\nparameters. We are gradually at one of three positions out of 132; they're at the bottom, so we \\n\\nhave to rectify the ICT infrastructure, the investment, the internet speed, the internet access, and \\n\\nthen basically what we see is actually the Venture Capital Fund. Nowadays, people don't believe \\n\\nin the banking system. I will share with you what the new landscapes are for the venture \\n\\ncapitalism and the private equity fund. It's nothing, 81% of the GDP, and then basically, it's the \\n\\nknowledge employment. We are at the one2 position in the technical employment, which means \\n\\nwe don't need engineers because we don't have the technical, uh, private corporate sector. \\n\\n So that's why basically that's very alarming unless and until we see in all dimensions things will \\n\\nbe missing because if you are producing engineers and if there is no technical need for the \\n\\ncorporate tech enterprises this is where we are to so it should be two-way traffic now talking \\n\\nabout the outputs and in the output I think we are at the 43 position that's the huge index because \\n\\nof the higher education since 2002 they've invested a lot and I think that's one of the good \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n69 \\n \\n\\nposition we are rank at 43 position but what is the impact of this Edge index what is the impact \\n\\nof this research.  \\n\\nIt's very important to know that there are basically these four levels: one is the concept level of \\n\\nthe product, the second is the development, then the pre-commercialization and early \\n\\ncommercialisation, and then the scale. the big companies 1 billion and you need different levels \\n\\nof investment in this in Pakistan.  \\n\\nI can say this in comparison to the UK and America then the Venture Capital fund I have \\n\\nVenture Capital is almost zero and then we don't have the big investment in private Equity funds \\n\\nand we don't have the loans for Innovation as it is in New America so we have only one part the \\n\\nsmall part of the ground and that's we always talking about the concept nothing is coming out \\n\\nunless and until we transfer the capital landscape and that should be at the Strategic level of the \\n\\ncountry or the province we will not move but that's the first harsh reality we have to change it let \\n\\nme tell you the figures in UK it's 24 29.4 billion pounds the private equity and Adventure Capital \\n\\nfunds and then so on and see the Red Zone in Pakistan it's only $74 million so no comparison at \\n\\nall.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 According to the neo-classical growth model, economic growth hinges on three key \\n\\ncomponents: knowledge (education and innovation), capital (foreign direct investment), and \\n\\nskilled labor. These elements must be present for sustained economic development, \\n\\ninnovation, and technological advancement. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 There is the for a comprehensive innovation ecosystem, which includes universities, \\n\\ngovernment support, private sector involvement, capital availability, and an entrepreneurial \\n\\nmindset. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 Pakistan faces significant challenges in its technological and innovation sectors, including \\n\\ninadequate investment in research and development (R&D), poor ICT infrastructure, and a \\n\\nlack of venture capital.  \\n\\n\\uf0b7 For Pakistan to achieve significant socio-economic development through technological \\n\\nadvancements, there must be a strategic focus on transforming the capital landscape \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n70 \\n \\n\\nSpeech by \",\n          \", Former Member Governance, Planning Commission \\n\\nTopic: \\u201cSocio-Economic aspects of projects in CPEC Phase-I\\u201d \\n\\nIt is a privilege to address you today on the socio-economic aspects of the projects undertaken \\n\\nduring the first phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). As we reflect on the \\n\\ntransformative impact of these projects, it is essential to recognize the immense opportunities \\n\\nthey have brought to Pakistan, especially in terms of employment and economic growth. \\n\\nPakistan, as many of you know, is one of the most populous countries in the world, ranking \\n\\namong the top five globally. This youthful population is on the cusp of entering the workforce, \\n\\nand as they do, the demand for jobs will inevitably surge. The CPEC initiative, Pakistan\\u2019s most \\n\\nsignificant development project to date, has been instrumental in addressing this pressing need. \\n\\nFrom its inception, CPEC has been envisioned as a catalyst for economic development and job \\n\\ncreation in Pakistan. The Planning \\n\\nCommission projected that CPEC would \\n\\ngenerate 1.6 million jobs by 2030. While \\n\\nthis ambitious target captured the \\n\\nimagination of many, the early phases of the \\n\\nproject revealed a gap between the skills of \\n\\njob seekers and the opportunities available. \\n\\nHowever, rather than a setback, this \\n\\nmismatch has served as a call to action\\u2014prompting us to align our educational and vocational \\n\\ntraining programs with the needs of a rapidly evolving job market. Despite these early \\n\\nchallenges, the impact of CPEC on employment in Pakistan has been profound. The \\n\\ninfrastructure and energy projects completed under CPEC Phase-I have not only enhanced the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n49 \\n \\n\\nnation\\u2019s physical and economic landscape but have also directly created approximately 70,000 \\n\\njobs. These opportunities have been vital in reducing unemployment and have had a ripple effect \\n\\nthroughout the economy, contributing significantly to Pakistan\\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). \\n\\nMoreover, CPEC\\u2019s influence extends beyond the borders of Pakistan. The project has also \\n\\ngenerated employment in China, both directly and indirectly, showcasing the mutual benefits of \\n\\nthis landmark initiative. The economic linkages forged through CPEC have strengthened the \\n\\nbond between our two nations, creating a framework for shared prosperity and regional stability. \\n\\nIt is crucial to understand that the socio-economic benefits of CPEC are not limited to job \\n\\ncreation alone. The infrastructure \\n\\nimprovements brought about by \\n\\nCPEC have had a transformative \\n\\neffect on Pakistan\\u2019s economy. The \\n\\nenhanced road networks, upgraded \\n\\nports, and improved energy supply \\n\\nhave not only facilitated commerce \\n\\nand trade but have also provided a \\n\\nsolid foundation for future industrial growth. These developments have attracted investment, \\n\\nboth domestic and foreign, creating a more dynamic and competitive economic environment. \\n\\nThe reduction in unemployment and the subsequent economic growth have also had positive \\n\\nsocial implications. As more people find gainful employment, we see improvements in living \\n\\nstandards, better access to education and healthcare, and overall enhanced quality of life. CPEC \\n\\nhas, in many ways, been a driver of social progress, helping to uplift communities across the \\n\\ncountry. \\n\\nLooking ahead, the lessons learned from Phase-I of CPEC will be invaluable as we move into the \\n\\nnext phases of the project. It is imperative that we continue to focus on skills development and \\n\\ncapacity building to ensure that the Pakistani workforce is equipped to meet the demands of a \\n\\nrapidly changing job market. By doing so, we can maximize the socio-economic benefits of \\n\\nCPEC, ensuring that the fruits of this partnership are shared widely and equitably. The socio-\\n\\neconomic impact of CPEC Phase-I has been overwhelmingly positive. The jobs created, the \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n50 \\n \\n\\ninfrastructure built, and the economic growth stimulated by these projects have laid a strong \\n\\nfoundation for Pakistan\\u2019s future.  \\n\\nKey Takeaways \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The Planning Commission projected that CPEC would generate 1.6 million jobs by 2030. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The economic linkages forged through CPEC have strengthened the bond between our two \\n\\nnations, creating a framework for shared prosperity and regional stability. \\n\\n\\uf0b7 The enhanced road networks, upgraded ports, and improved energy supply have not only \\n\\nfacilitated commerce and trade but have also provided a solid foundation for future industrial \\n\\ngrowth. \\n\\n \\n\\nSpeech by \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
